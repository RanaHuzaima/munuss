We take the confidentiality of our client\u2019s information very seriously. All accounts, statements and reports prepared by us are for your exclusive use within your business or to meet specific statutory responsibilities. They will not be shown to any third party without your prior consent.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.2. You may appoint someone else to speak to us on your behalf such as your spouse. However, we would require your consent in writing. Please contact us for further details.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.3.

This agreement will remain effective from the date we receive your completed registration form. Either party may vary or terminate our authority to act on your behalf at any time without penalty, unless cancellation is before your first month\u2019s payment. In that instance, a \u00a330 fee will become payable to cover our administration costs. Notice of termination must be given in writing or via email. No monthly payments will be refunded to you at any time and cannot be transferred, regardless of whether you have used our services or not, or if your year-end procedure has been performed or not.<\/p>\n<p>3.0.2. These terms and conditions may change from time to time. We always strive to let clients know in advance of a change being made, but it is your responsibility to review the terms regularly for changes made.<\/p>\n<p>3.0.3.\u00a0If an indemnity claim is made against direct debit payments that were due to be paid, then this amount will be payable to us immediately along with a \u00a330 charge to cover the cost of the indemnity claim to us from our direct debit agency.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/b><b>Payments<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>Clients who register with us after 20\/12\/2017<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>4.0.1<strong>. <\/strong>Once registered for the service we will issue monthly invoices for your current financial year. Direct debit payments will be collected on a monthly basis for the invoiced amounts. Your first invoice and direct debit will include a backdated amount to the start of your current financial period, for example: if your financial period is 1<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0January to 31<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0December with a monthly fee of \u00a350 and your first direct debit payment is 1<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0June; your first invoice and direct debit amount will be \u00a3300 (6 months x \u00a350); and \u00a350 per month thereafter.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to terminate our service part way through your financial year then no further monthly invoices will be raised from the date of your written cancellation. If you cancel part way through your financial year and would like us to complete that financial year\u2019s work then we would agree to either continue the monthly invoices until the end of the financial year or raise a final invoice up to the financial year end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Clients who registered with us before 20\/12\/2017<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>4.0.2. Once registered for the service we will issue an invoice for your current financial year. Direct debit payments will be collected on a monthly basis that will reduce the amount of that invoice.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to terminate our service part way through your financial year then we will raise a credit note for the remaining term of the current financial year and inform you of the balance due if there is one. If you have been switched to monthly invoicing then a credit note will not be required as the monthly invoices will be dated up to the current month only.<\/p>\n<p>If you cancel part way through your financial year and would like us to complete that financial year\u2019s work then we would agree to either continue the monthly invoices until the end of the financial year or raise a final invoice up to the financial year end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All Clients<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>4.0.3. If you register with us and we find that there is outstanding work due for previous periods then we will contact you straight away for your instruction on whether or not you would like us to give you a quotation for the work involved. A previous period is where a period end is before the current date. For example, if today\u2019s date were 1<sup>st<\/sup> May 2017 and a self-assessment was due for period 6<sup>th<\/sup> April 2016 to 5<sup>th<\/sup> April 2017 then this would be a previous period.<\/p>\n<p>4.0.4. From time to time we will increase fees to keep up with inflation or increasing costs. We will notify you of any fee increases at least 14 days in advance.<\/p>\n<p>4.0.5. Your quotation is based on the information you have provided to us about you and your business. If your business circumstances change then we may adjust our fees to align with these changes. For example, if your business received a quotation based on a turnover bracket and this increases or decreases then the fees will be adjusted to suit. Similarly if you engage us for payroll and add more employees than we have quoted you for then the fee will adjust with these changes. For a breakdown of how our fees are calculated please request a pricing guide from us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Clients without a Direct Debit facility<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>4.0.6<strong>. <\/strong>Monthly fees are collected by credit\/debit card through Stripe. If or when you change your accountancy package you agree that The Accountancy Partnership may initiate a payment for the agreed fee instantly and recurring monthly thereafter. The fee amount will be determined by the price for the accountancy package at the time of upgrading\/registering which can be seen on The Accountancy Partnership website when selecting the desired additional services from the get an instant quote form or as quoted by a member of the team.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/b><b>Late Payments\/defaults<\/b><\/p>\n<p>5.0.1.

You have a business establishment in the UK and no fixed establishment elsewhere that is more closely connected with the supply 2. You have a business establishment outside of the UK and a fixed establishment in the UK that is mostly directly connected with the supply 3.

We will be able to act on your behalf for all of your businesses accounting and taxation affairs from the date that we receive your registration form.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.2. We will prepare the accounts and tax return based on the records and other information and explanations provided by you.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.3. Your approval will be required before we submit any accounts or returns to Companies House or HMRC.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.4. We will advise you as to the amounts of tax to be paid and the dates by which you should make the payments.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.5. If after we complete your accounts\/tax return you should request amendments to be made to the work already completed, then a quotation will be given to you for the additional work involved. We will deal with HMRC regarding any amendments required to your return and prepare any amended returns which may be required.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.6. Any overpayment that arises will be paid into our client account from HMRC and transferred to your bank account the same working day through faster payment.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.7. We will undertake all correspondence with HMRC on your behalf unless instructed otherwise by you.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.8. It is important that you send your records to us in good time before any deadlines. We will send out frequent reminders from the date of your financial year end so that you know that we require your records.<\/p>\n<p>14.0.9. HMRC investigate a proportion of the tax returns submitted each year. Businesses are selected either at random or because submitted figures look incorrect. As long as your service with us remains active we will represent you during an investigation at no additional charge.<\/p>\n<p>14.1.0. You agree that we can approach such third parties as may be appropriate for information that we consider necessary to deal with your affairs.<\/p>\n<p>14.1.1.\u00a0If you have registered with us as a limited company, up to 2 director\u2019s self-assessments are included within your fee. Self-assessment periods run from 6<sup>th<\/sup> April one year to 5<sup>th<\/sup> April the next. The first one to be included in your fee will be the self-assessment period that your first company&#8217;s financial year end falls in. For example, if your first company\u2019s financial year with us is 1<sup>st<\/sup> July 2017 to 30<sup>th<\/sup> June 2018 the self-assessment(s) included will be for period 6<sup>th<\/sup> April 2018 to 5<sup>th<\/sup> April 2019.<\/p>\n<p>14.1.2.\u00a0We are general accountants and small business tax specialists and we are able to cater for the vast majority of accounts\/tax requirements a small business may have. Where we do not have the relevant skills\/expertise we will always endeavour to consult with affiliates for assistance. However there are instances where a specialist is required. For example, if your business requires services such as EIS\/SEIS form completion, R&amp;D tax repayments, advice on investments, or TOMS advice we may have to refer you to a specialist who can help. Such specialists may charge a fee for these services.<\/p>\n<p>14.1.3. For limited companies. As UK accountants our service only applies to UK entities, i.e. UK companies or UK tax payers. We cannot offer advice relating to other tax jurisdictions. Where you and\/or your company could be considered tax resident in a country other than the UK it is your responsibility to seek advice from a professional who has expertise in that jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, if a company is incorporated in the UK, it has corporate residency in the UK. However, there can be exceptions. We only engage with and act on behalf of companies which are resident in the UK, and as such you agree that you have considered your corporate residency and it is that of the UK.<\/p>\n<p>14.1.4. If you sign up to our service as a <strong>limited company<\/strong>, you are entitled to free self-assessments for up to two directors. Included in the free self-assessments can be employment income, employment benefits, UK benefits (including state pension), dividends relating to the UK company that is registered to our service and UK interest which is below \u00a31,000. If there are additional sources of income such as property income or foreign dividends, then there will be additional fees incurred, these will be quoted and agreed in advance of the work taking place. If your limited company is a property company, and you dispose of a property, there will be an additional charge in the accounting period for disposal. This will be quoted and agreed in advance of the work taking place.<\/p>\n<p>14.1.5. If you sign up to our service as a <strong>sole trader<\/strong>, partnership or individual, your self-assessment tax return is included in the fee. Your self-assessment can include employment income, employment benefits, UK benefits (including state pension) and UK interest which is below \u00a31,000. If there are additional sources of income such as property income or foreign dividends, then there will likely be additional fees which will be quoted and agreed in advance of the work taking place.<\/p>\n<p>14.1.6. If your company is eligible to claim Research and Development (R&#038;D) Relief, and you are claiming for the first time or have not claimed in the previous 3 financial periods, then HMRC state that you must notify them within 6 months after your financial period end for which you are claiming for. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure you meet all deadlines requested by HMRC, we do not offer this service and you would need to appoint a specialist to assist you in this area.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>15.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/b><b>VAT Returns (if applicable)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>15.0.1. We will be able to act on your behalf for your businesses VAT affairs from the date your registration form is received by us.

We will advise you as to amounts of VAT to be paid (or repaid to you) and the dates by which you should make any payments.<\/p>\n<p>15.0.4. We will undertake all correspondence with HMRC on your behalf unless instructed to do otherwise by you.<\/p>\n<p>15.0.5. Please ensure all supplies made by the business are shown in the records made available to us. It should be understood that our appointment as your agent does not absolve your business from its statutory responsibilities. We would draw your attention to the strict rules and time limits for the submission of such returns and the substantial penalties which may arise if these are not observed. It is therefore essential that we receive full information from you promptly to enable us to ensure that the returns are made on a timely basis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>16.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/b><b>Payroll (if applicable)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>16.0.1. To process your payroll we will require certain information from you. This includes:<\/p>\n<p>16.0.2. Notification within two weeks of any employee who is ill for four or more calendar days, including weekends, bank holidays etc. This will enable us to operate statutory sick pay for you.<\/p>\n<p>16.0.3. Notification of any employee who becomes pregnant. This will enable us to operate statutory maternity pay.<\/p>\n<p>16.0.4.

Completed P46 forms should be supplied to us for processing. Please contact us if you would like us to explain this process.<\/p>\n<p>16.1.0. RTI returns must be received by HMRC on the day that you pay employees so it is very important that we receive your payroll records on time.<\/p>\n<p>16.1.1. It should be understood that our appointment as your agent does not absolve your business from its statutory responsibilities. We would draw your attention to the strict rules and time limits for the submission of such returns and the substantial penalties which may arise if these are not observed. It is therefore essential that we receive full information from you promptly to enable us to ensure that the returns are made on a timely basis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>17.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/b><b>Bookkeeping (if applicable)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>17.0.1. If you appoint us to complete bookkeeping on your behalf, we will input your business transactions into a system that best suits your business. We will require all business documentation needed to complete the bookkeeping including sales invoices, purchase invoices, expense receipts, bank statements, paying in\/cheque books and credit card statements (if applicable).<\/p>\n<p>17.0.2. We will keep your paperwork until your year-end procedures have been completed, unless otherwise instructed by you. Once we have finished with your records we will return them to you via recorded delivery.<\/p>\n<p>17.0.3. If you complete your own bookkeeping then we would expect to receive records in a reconciled state (if a double entry system is appropriate). We will take samples to check that the bookkeeping has been completed properly. We will bring to your attention anything that does not seem correct and will await your instructions on how to proceed before continuing with your work. If you would like us to correct any bookkeeping errors we will produce a quotation for you to agree upon before any work is carried out.<\/p>\n<p>17.0.4. If after we complete your bookkeeping, you request amendments to be made to the work already completed, then a quotation will be given to you for the additional work involved.<\/p>\n<p>17.0.5. The bookkeeping quote we provide to you prior to registering with us is based on the volume of transactions you estimate your business produces. Sometimes we find that the actual amount of transactions is more than you initially estimated. In this instance we would raise an invoice for the volume of transactions which exceed your original estimation at our current price per transaction.<\/p>\n<p>17.0.6. If you have special requests for your bookkeeping requirements or where there is a greater than average amount of complexity &#8211; we may quote an hourly rate rather than the standard transactional rate. If we receive bookkeeping records which are more complex than initially estimated we may recalculate the quotation. We will always ask for your agreement of the revised quotation before proceeding with the work.<\/p>\n<p>17.0.7. If we are completing your bookkeeping, the records you send to us (whether electronic or paper based) must be presented in an orderly fashion. Where there is significant time required for us to organise your records we may quote an additional fee for this work.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>18. Registered office address (if applicable):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>18.0.1. Our registered office address service will only forward correspondence relating to a client\u2019s accountancy obligations from Companies House and HMRC.<\/p>\n<p>18.0.2. If any correspondence is received which is unrelated to our accountancy obligations we will notify clients via email to advise that this address needs to be changed. If we continue to receive this type of correspondence after clients have been notified to update their address, we reserve the right to increase our fee for this service, or remove it completely.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<strong>19. Contractors and IR35 (if applicable):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>19.0.1. If some or all of your business relates to contracting then you should consider your risk to IR35. IR35 is legislation that aims to prevent contractors benefiting from tax advantages over that of an employee acting in a similar capacity. It is your responsibility to assess your risk to IR35 although we are happy to provide guidance and material that will help you decide whether you are likely to be inside or outside of the legislation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>20.\u00a0<\/strong><b>Fair Usage policy:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>20.0.1.

We are aware that new clients will require more help and advice when they first register with us\u00a0or if they\u00a0are new to business\u00a0and\u00a0we do take this into consideration.<\/p>\n<p>20.0.2. If we consider a client to be in breach of this policy we will notify them in writing to give a choice of either an increased fee or a reduction in their demands on\u00a0the time of our accountants.<\/p>\n<p>20.0.3. The unlimited help and advice included within your chosen package relates to the services you have appointed us to complete. For specialist advice or advice relating to topics outside of your selected services, we would seek to charge a reasonable fee that would be relative to the work involved, and will be agreed upon by both parties prior to any work being undertaken.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>21.
