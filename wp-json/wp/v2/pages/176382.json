For instance, if you\u2019re a sole trader, receive income from property, a partner in a partnership (and for the partnership itself), or the director of a limited company who also receives dividends as a shareholder. Submitting Self Assessment doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ll have a bill to pay, and can sometimes result in a tax rebate. This process is expected to change for some taxpayers in April 2026, with the introduction of MTD Income Tax Self Assessment.\"\n    }\n  },{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"When should I submit my Self Assessment tax return?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"The deadline for submitting an online Self Assessment tax return is normally 31st January following the end of the tax year it relates to.
