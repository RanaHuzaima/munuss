Lauren explains her role as an accountant here at The Accountancy Partnership.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your job title?<\/h3>\n<p>Accounts Manager<\/p>\n<h3>Give an overview of the duties, functions, and responsibilities of your job.<\/h3>\n<p>Managing my client\u2019s tax, accounts, and VAT responsibilities is a big part of my job. We offer ongoing support to clients throughout the year via email and calls. <\/p>\n<p>As Accounts Manager I also have internal duties, which involves many, many, many spreadsheets! I try to ensure a happy environment for our accounting department by helping them with day-to-day queries and support. <\/p>\n<p>I work closely with a number of our trainees, helping them with queries, building their knowledge, and ensuring they are on the right path to working independently. <\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>Having multiple responsibilities means the day really does fly! A typical working day begins with emails helping clients with any queries then may have. <\/p>\n<p>The rest of my day can then vary. Sometimes I will have meetings with staff\/trainees\/managers, and other managerial tasks in between working on my clients\u2019 tax and accounts needs. <\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Managing my time to ensure all duties are met. Working in accountancy also means constantly changing legislation which I need to keep up to date with. <\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Brexit and Covid-19 are the two current big challenges faced by clients. Day to day I help clients with queries on these matters. It is important to us that clients have the best possible advice on this, to ensure they are supported during this difficult time. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I am ACCA qualified and ensure I have regular CPD to ensure I keep on top of constantly changing legislation. <\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>Helping to provide support to my team, I enjoy ensuring they are happy in work. <\/p>\n<p>I also enjoy training new members of staff as that feels very personally rewarding, knowing you are helping them to progress with their career and pushing their personal development. <\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>Definitely the staff (the TAP fam)! There is a very friendly feel to the office, and everyone is always supporting each other day to day. Work may be stressful at times, but I can always count on the others to put a smile on my face every day! <\/p>\n<p>LOVE the days and nights out also! We recently had our Christmas night out in Liverpool which was fantastic! Everyone had so much fun dancing and singing.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Communication is absolutely key. It\u2019s important to have good rapport with clients to ensure we understand their business and needs, and it\u2019s also important between staff members.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>Days off usually involve walking my dogs along New Brighton. It\u2019s great having such a lovely area on my doorstep!<\/p>\n<p>I also enjoy heading across the Mersey to Liverpool for food and drinks!
