My primary focus is company operations and trying to continually improve these, not only to provide a better service for our clients, but also support our staff as best we can.<\/p>\n<h3> What is a typical working day like for you? <\/h3>\n<p>No two days are ever the same for me as my focus and targets are ever changing depending on what we feel needs work. <\/p>\n<p>I always start the day by responding to emails and messages I have received overnight. I\u2019ll usually be working on various reports looking at company performance and financials, which myself and Lee, our MD, will discuss and use to make decisions about the coming months. <\/p>\n<p>There are often meetings booked in with various managers to discuss department performance and ideas. I also take time every day to review client feedback and consider ways in which we can improve.<\/p>\n<h3> What particular challenges do you regularly encounter? <\/h3>\n<p>Everyone &#8211; colleagues and clients &#8211; is different with individual needs, so we always want to make sure that we\u2019re doing the best we can, and offering the right support.<\/p>\n<h3> What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients? <\/h3>\n<p>Setting up and running a new business is a very brave thing to do and I can imagine accounting and tax responsibilities must be very daunting for a lot of new business owners. I hope that our friendly and approachable team of accountants helps make this easier for them.  <\/p>\n<h3> What is your favourite part of the job? <\/h3>\n<p>To be honest it\u2019s hard to pick anything in particular as I love my job so much. I really love seeing the company grow and contributing towards this. I also really love it when we organise fun things for staff and seeing how happy it makes people. <\/p>\n<p>It has always been a priority for both me and for Lee to create a fun and positive working environment, and it makes me really proud when you can see that people visibly enjoy working here.<\/p>\n<h3> What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership? <\/h3>\n<p>The Team. I don\u2019t think you could get a better bunch of people working together. Everyone is so hard working but also fun and positive. We couldn\u2019t ask for better staff.<\/p>\n<h3> What skills do you find most useful to do your job? <\/h3>\n<p>Thinking critically is crucial to constant improvement. I always have to assume we could be doing better, even when things appear to be working well. That\u2019s not to say you need to be negative, but you cannot become complacent.  <\/p>\n<h3> Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off? <\/h3>\n<p>I love going for a family walk followed by a pub lunch (and a large glass of red).<\/p>\n<h3> Tell us about your proudest achievement. <\/h3>\n<p>My daughter Ruby. She\u2019s so hilarious, intelligent, and beautiful &#8211; I feel so lucky to be her mum.<\/p>\n<h3> How would your colleagues describe you? <\/h3>\n<p>Eeesh, I definitely don\u2019t think punctual would be up there!<\/p>\n<h3> What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment? <\/h3>\n<p>The Last Kingdom on Netflix &#8211; Destiny is All!<\/p>\n<h3> Who do you admire, and why? <\/h3>\n<p>I really admire my brother; I find him really inspiring and am constantly learning from him. (Don\u2019t tell him I said that!)<\/p>\n<h3> What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?! <\/h3>\n<p>How many scented candles is too many? Answer &#8211; the limit does not exist. <\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
