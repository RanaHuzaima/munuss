My job is to make sure that we provide <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">useful information to our clients<\/a>, on the topics that they most need help with. We try to use a variety of formats, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/accountancy-news-and-articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blogs<\/a>, guides, help centre content, e-mails, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Without being boring about it (and everyone in a five-desk radius will confirm that I can be), it involves a lot of reviewing, commissioning content, copy editing, planning, strategy, and general maintenance. I tend to approach our content with the mindset that no matter how good the last piece of work, there\u2019s always more we can do to improve.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>It usually starts at the coffee maker so I can start forming coherent sentences, and then onwards to the content calendar to see what\u2019s coming up. I tend to work as far in advance as possible, which gives me time to deal with projects that have a shorter turnaround.<\/p>\n<p>During the day I\u2019m usually in contact with our team of writers, the rest of the marketing department, our developers\u2026 Slack is my friend. My days are varied, which I really enjoy.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Some of what we do is quite technical, so I need to make sure I understand it before attempting to make sure we\u2019re explaining it properly.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, like most jobs, there are deadlines \u2013 some with a lot less lead time than others. It\u2019s why we spend time making sure our planning and strategy can stand up to real-life stress testing.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also an on-site gym, which can definitely be challenging.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tax returns<\/a>, to compliance, market conditions, global pandemics\u2026 People running their own business have a lot to deal with, and they\u2019re largely going it alone &#8211; that must be daunting.<\/p>\n<p>Reviewing our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/client-of-the-month\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Client of the Month articles<\/a> is probably one of my favourite tasks, each one is like a pep talk. We\u2019re all rooting for you!<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>Tax and finance are big subjects, so it\u2019s important that we understand what our clients need to know (even if they don\u2019t realise that they need to know it), and communicate this in a way that makes sense to anyone.<\/p>\n<p>It means lots of research, planning, strategy, creativity, problem solving, scheduling, more scheduling, and being ruthlessly organised. My boss will likely read this, so obviously these are all things I\u2019m wonderful at.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I love problem-solving, helping other people solve problems, and enjoy written communications, so this job ticks some big boxes for me. Each day is different, and I get to constantly learn new things.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>TAP go to a lot of effort to make this a nice place to work, and it shows. I think that really sets TAP apart. I\u2019ve always had help when I\u2019ve needed to ask for it. Everyone\u2019s got a good sense of humour too and more importantly, they laugh at my jokes.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Ruthless organisation, creativity, analytical and logical thinking, and an ability to translate \u2018tech\u2019 into \u2018people\u2019 without being (too) precious. Sometimes you just have to put your ego aside and respect that someone else&#8217;s idea is better.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>The mountains or the sea.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>My daughter.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve somehow signed up to do Tough Mudder too, which fills me with terrified laughter \u2013 so watch this space for our charity fundraising!<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Witty, sarky, and lovely apparently. (I was very selective who I asked).<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>Pretty much everything! I read a lot.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>I hit the jackpot with the people around me. I hero worship them all. I\u2019m forever grateful that I get to be in their gang.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Cake, or a biscuit? Yes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
