Most days usually start by spending time doing emails \u2013 making sure I clear everything from the day before answering any staff or client queries.<\/p>\n<p>I also work a lot in Sage \u2013 raising invoices, sorting fee queries, balancing accounts etc. for the accountants. After that, it varies \u2013 staff check ins, meetings, recruitment to name a few, and then we are constantly thinking of ways to improve existing processes and creating new ones to make us more efficient at what we do.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Being a busy team in such a fast-growing company means we have to make sure we have everything in place to run smoothly and efficiently. Juggling numerous priorities at once is always a challenge.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>I think at the moment it\u2019s COVID. It\u2019s been such an uncertain, weird time for everyone.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m very organised and efficient at what I do, as I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time. Any client that comes to me with a problem or query, I\u2019m confident I can provide a quick resolution!<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>For me, it\u2019s the variety. We have such a range of tasks to keep on top of, working out fee queries one minute, and organising an upcoming TAP activity the next. I also love being busy and having lots of things on the go at once.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s got to be the office atmosphere and the people. It\u2019s such a great place to come to work, and we are all very well looked after. I\u2019ve worked here such a long-time that colleagues have become friends, and what\u2019s not to like about working with all your mates!<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Being very organised, and on top of things in general, helps with this job. I\u2019m a perfectionist and want everything just right. I also love a good list, which comes in very handy!<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>Anywhere outdoors \u2013 we love going into Wales hiking or going to the beach, and just generally being out in the countryside with the dogs.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>It would probably be buying and renovating our first house, which were currently about halfway through. We have been there a year and a half, and have completely transformed the areas finished so far.<\/p>\n<p>It was built in the 1800\u2019s and was an absolute mess when we moved in. It\u2019s by far the hardest, most stressful thing I\u2019ve ever done, and it can get very overwhelming at times, but I know it will be 100% worth it once finished!<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>I asked this out loud and got the following \u2013 \u2018like a skittle &#8211; hard on the outside but soft on the inside\u2019.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>We have just finished the Netflix series \u2018Inventing Anna\u2019, and now we\u2019re on the lookout for something new to start.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Q. Summer or Winter?<br \/>\nA. Controversial for most \u2013 Winter!<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
