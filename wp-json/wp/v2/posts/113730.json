A lot of my job is training new bookkeepers too, and making sure they are settling in well. <\/p>\n<p>I also provide support for TAP&#8217;s very own bookkeeping software, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/free-bookkeeping-software\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pandle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>I always start the day off by responding to any emails\/queries that have come in overnight. After that, I\u2019ll spend the day <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/bookkeeping-services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">completing bookkeeping<\/a> and supporting the trainees, as well as keeping on top of queries through the day.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>The main challenge would be ensuring deadlines are met, as well as keeping the work to the highest standard. It would be easy to rush the work sometimes, but it\u2019s important to make sure that everything is done correctly as well as on time.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to look past COVID in recent years. I can only imagine how hard it is running a business without the added complications caused by the pandemic.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>My qualifications and experience can help provide a better understanding to our clients of what we are doing, and why it is necessary, as well as just completing the work.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>Bookkeeping can be a strenuous task, so I enjoy being able to complete this for our clients. Taking that pressure away from them has a nice feeling.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019d have to say the people here. The office has a great atmosphere, and everyone helps each other through each day. We all work hard, but there\u2019s always something to laugh about.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s 5-a-side football every week too, which is good fun.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m very organised and work well under pressure, which helps with managing work and meeting deadlines.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m a massive Everton fan, so it would definitely be Goodison Park (although the visits haven\u2019t been as enjoyable lately)!<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>Graduating, however I will give a special mention to winning the local Sunday football league.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Easy going, sarcastic, and the one with all the desk decorations.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I am always binge-watching Friends, to the point I only need to listen, and I know what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of reading, I can\u2019t get enough of the helpful Pandle guides!<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>My parents \u2013 they have always been there for me and supported everything I\u2019ve done.<\/p>\n<p>As a football fan, I\u2019ll go for Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, they are both brilliant to watch. <\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ll follow on from the above<\/p>\n<p>Q. Who\u2019s the greatest footballer of all time?<\/p>\n<p>A. Messi edges it for me, I just think he\u2019s more naturally gifted.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
