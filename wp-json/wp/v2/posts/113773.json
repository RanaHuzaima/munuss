I am learning new skills to overcome these challenges daily.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems?<\/h3>\n<p>I always like to try and use the knowledge I have learnt in my previous finance rolls to work out what I need to do next before asking for help.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I love problem solving, so if something does not balance, I really enjoy working out why and fixing it.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>I most enjoy the friendly atmosphere at TAP. It can be daunting starting in a new company of this scale, but everyone made me feel welcome from day one.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>I am a really determined person, so I think this is the most useful skill, as it means that I don\u2019t give up when I don\u2019t understand something. I am happy to ask for help and learn.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I love going to the woods with my dog. I generally enjoy anything to do with nature, it keeps me calm and helps my mind relax ready for the following week.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>I would say being at the stage I am right now. My biggest criticism at school was that I was a day dreamer. I think I was a little confused when I left school as to what direction to take. Luckily, I fell into the world of finance and discovered AAT. I couldn\u2019t be happier to have a vision for the future in my head, finally!<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>I honestly think it would be multiple words. Friendly (I hope), a little bit quirky, and I probably don\u2019t know when the conversation has ended either!<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I love a good thriller, something with a big twist at the end or a serial killer documentary. I also love repeatedly watching US Office, or Gavin and Stacey. <\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>I really admire Katie Piper. I remember watching her documentary when I was younger, and her acid attack had not long happened. It really stuck in my head and I felt so sorry for her. Now she\u2019s picked herself up and built a career helping others. I admire anyone that goes through a dark period and has the determination to make something of their lives.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
