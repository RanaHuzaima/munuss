I usually then look to start working on a set of accounts or a tax\/VAT return. <\/p>\n<p>Throughout the day I respond to any client queries that come in, and carry out any peer reviews which need completing. We all check each other\u2019s work to ensure high standards.  <\/p>\n<p>On Tuesdays and Wednesdays a few of us like to keep fit by going for a run along the River Mersey at lunchtime.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>The main challenge we regularly encounter is meeting deadlines, particularly in busy periods such in January, or leading up to VAT deadline dates. But we always strive to work hard for our clients, and we take pride in meeting their expectations of our service.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>When clients are first starting out with their own business, being faced with the world of accounting when they are trying to focus on the day-to-day operations and growing their business can be challenging. That\u2019s where we come in, to help in any way we can!<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m studying towards completing the AAT, so I\u2019m gaining knowledge constantly, as well as the practical experience that I have from this and previous roles. <\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I enjoy talking to clients and getting to know them and their businesses. As we have such a wide-ranging client base, no two clients are the same and each one has their own unique set of circumstances and challenges. It\u2019s great to talk through their business with them and help with whatever queries they have, especially when they are first starting out.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>The office atmosphere is great, especially after a long stint of working from home &#8211; it was great to get back to a busy office. Everyone is friendly and happy to support each other with anything.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Communication is a key part of our job, and as all our clients are different it\u2019s important to be able to communicate with our clients in whatever way suits them best. Some clients prefer to stick to email, whereas others want to discuss things over the phone, so it\u2019s important to be able to adapt to the clients\u2019 needs and wants. <\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p> It would have to be the golf course<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>I once completed an Olympic Length Triathlon for Sport Relief which I was very proud of, but I was also unable to walk for 3 days afterwards.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>After the Christmas party\u2026 a great dancer!<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>A bit late to the party, but I\u2019ve just got into Ozark.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019d have to say former Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield. His best mate Rob Burrow was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease a few years ago, and since then Sinfield has raised over \u00a32m for the MND association doing challenges like running 100 miles in 24 hours, and 7 marathons in 7 days. I just find what he\u2019s doing very inspiring, and he doesn\u2019t quite get the plaudits he deserves.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Q. Is pineapple acceptable on top of a pizza?<\/p>\n<p>A. Absolutely not!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
