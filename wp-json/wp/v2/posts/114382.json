I also have a team that I train on our systems and to complete accounts and tax returns. <\/p>\n<p>My next priority is then our wonderful client base. I have my own clients who I service day to day, and thoroughly enjoy working alongside to complete their accounts, VAT, and personal tax returns. I also oversee any clients who may have queries relating to their accountant\u2019s advice or service, which our client experience manager need my support with. <\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>There are no two days the same when managing a large team. Some days can involve meetings, client calls and accounts preparation. Other days can include interviewing candidates for up-and-coming roles, and training new staff members. This keeps my job extremely rewarding and exciting. <\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Being an accountant is challenging in its own right, with clients having deadlines to meet every month. This is part of the job and something that most of our accountants thrive on! <\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Our clients come in all forms, from limited companies to sole trader individuals, so no two clients have the same experience. I am lucky in that I get to work first-hand with a wide range of clients outside of my own client base.<\/p>\n<p>What clients tend to struggle with most is when they first set up their business. There is so much to learn and take on board, so all of our accountants offer an initial consultation when clients first join us. It\u2019s an invaluable tool for clients to go through their initial concerns, and know that we can help them right from the start.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>My regular clients and I often speak and email, and we have built up a positive working relationship where they know I am always a call or email away for any of their needs.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>Now this is a tricky question &#8211; I do really enjoy working alongside clients as I have a strong customer service background. However, if I have to pick a favourite part it would be seeing new staff come on board and grow into successful accountants. This is so rewarding to see. <\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>I love my job and enjoy coming to work each day. We have a relaxed atmosphere in the office which allows us to remain calm and work efficiently even at stressful periods of the year. Although TAP has many staff, we all still feel like one big team, and everyone genuinely gets along which is great. The free gym is also my favourite perk! <\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, everything I learned whilst studying, but along with that my customer service skills, patience, understanding and empathy! Also, being organised and highly efficient helps too. <\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I have two beautiful dogs who I love to walk at the weekend, anywhere from the beach to the mountains. <\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>My two teenage children, who are now not so little. They are my proudest achievement and make me the person I am today. Without them I would never have embarked on the path of accountancy. <\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Well, being the manager I&#8217;m sure there may be things I don&#8217;t wish to know\u2026 however I would like to think that it would be fun, hardworking, supportive, and ambitious. <\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I actually don&#8217;t read or watch much TV, so going to pass on this question! <\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>There is not one person I admire, but I admire anyone who goes after their goals and dreams. Life is short and so I love to see people who take every opportunity in life. <\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Q. What sort of a question is this?<br \/>\nA. I have no idea!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
