Then it\u2019s on to checking through emails, and calling clients who have already been in touch with us to go over questions, quotes, and the information they will need to help them grow as self-employed individuals or Limited Company Directors.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Occasionally clients need or require more information than a sales executive can offer, as we are not qualified accountants. We have ways around this like having a buddy accountant for smaller questions. We can also arrange paid consultations with the accountants, so they get the correct and best advice before deciding to join us. <\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>A lot of our clients are start up businesses or are new to being self-employed, so a big challenge is helping them understand what it takes to be compliant and to make it a success. <\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I find being open and approachable the best way to handle any problems you face. That way everything can be worked out until everyone is happy.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>My favourite part of the job is seeing somebody feel happy and comfortable with what lies ahead for their business after we\u2019ve spent time helping them understand what they need, and how we can help. <\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>Clich\u00e9 answer being my team. We are a busy team who love to joke around, but we help each other out when needed.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Being confident on the phone, and being a good listener. We need to be able to understand what our clients need. <\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>Either in the local park outside my house walking our dog, or meeting up for a coffee\/wine with my Mum and Dad<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>I moved overseas to the Middle East when I was 21 &#8211; not sure what I was thinking at the time! But I am really proud of taking that big step into the unknown and making the most amazing memories for the 12 years I was there.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>First word that\u2019s comes to mind is loud, and I get called old every day of the week too, (running joke). I also hope they would think of me as a caring person too. \ud83d\ude0a <\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m late to the party with Afterlife at the moment. I love a good cry and that doesn\u2019t fail. I only watch it on my own in case I\u2019m an ugly crier (I am an ugly crier).<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>Another clich\u00e9 answer alert! I would have to say my parents! They worked so hard for us when I was a child, and they are just the best company. I want to be like that when I grow up!<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Should chocolate be kept in the fridge? Yes, oh yes it should!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
