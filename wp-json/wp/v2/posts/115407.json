We like to ensure that each member of our team is happy within their role and that they know they are important to us. We also have many tasks ranging from completing weekly\/monthly reports to planning staff nights out!<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>As soon as I come into the office, I like to make a cup of tea before tackling my emails until around 11am. After that I spend a bit of time organising my tasks for the afternoon around any meetings we may have planned for that day. Typically, my afternoon is spent using SAGE, helping the accountants where I can along with looking into new processes that we can put in place to help keep admin running smoothly.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>As the company is growing so rapidly, we are always trying to stay one step ahead when hiring for admin to ensure that we can keep on top of all tasks and continue to offer a great service for our clients.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Since COVID, a lot of our client\u2019s businesses have taken a hit financially so we are always trying to help our clients where we can.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I think just listening and having a sympathetic approach can really help when a client is feeling stressed or overwhelmed, as this shows we really do care, and we will do whatever we can to help.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>My favourite part of the job has to be looking after my team and organising all of the fun TAP events that we do, such as the quarterly nights out!<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>It has to be the office environment and the people that I work with. I have made some great friends here and never dread coming into work! TAP really makes a lot of effort to make this a great place to work.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Being organised is definitely the most useful skill you can have when working within admin, as more often than not I find I\u2019m working on more than one task at a time.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>We have been enjoying walks in Tatton Park recently but if I\u2019m not there, I\u2019m usually in the pub with some friends!<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>Saving up to buy a house! Having to limit my ASOS orders has been hard!<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Laid back and approachable.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>At the moment I\u2019m watching Inventing Anna, but you will usually find Friends or Gavin and Stacey on my TV.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>My grandma. She\u2019s been through a lot but is still always laughing and making jokes &#8211; she has some great stories too!<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be? I\u2019d love to go to Barbados!<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
