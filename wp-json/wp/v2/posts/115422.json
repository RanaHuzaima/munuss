For these clients I prepare the accounts, tax returns, and do their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/vat-return-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VAT returns<\/a> if applicable.<\/p>\n<p>All new clients get an initial call with me if they would like one, which is a key part of my job and lets me get to know my clients and their background better, and their goals for the business.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>All my days are structured. First thing in the morning I spend time replying to client emails and answering any questions they have, which leads me onto initial calls which I aways have 10 am-12 pm set aside for.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of my day up until and after lunch I spend doing any work such as preparing accounts and tax returns, and of course answering any calls from clients that need to speak with me.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Having a client portfolio also comes with deadlines. I would say this is an ongoing challenge as I always like to make sure my clients accounts and returns are submitted on time to avoid them incurring any penalties, even if that means we must turn it around in a short space of time. It\u2019s why it is so necessary that I stay organised to manage the approaching deadlines.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Having a wide range of clients means that the challenges they face can be unique to their business and circumstances, so there is not always a simple fix-all solution. Whether their query\/problem is big or small, I always put the same amount of effort into each one, and always try to help as quickly as I possibly can.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I love to hear and learn more about my clients and their business as it makes the job feel personal to each one, instead of just being names and numbers on a screen. Hearing the customer satisfaction is also a great part of the job, knowing we have helped them out and made something that little bit easier.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>Aside from the fact that they pay me, both the work environment and the people who work here are great. I have only been here for 7 months so far, but it has been a very enjoyable experience and I look forward to years to come.<\/p>\n<p>They provide catered meals and smoothies twice a week, and there is also a games room and gym where we can unwind and spend some time.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>I would say time management is an essential skill day-to-day, making sure I set aside enough time for any task I am needing to complete. However, the most important skill is compassion, as it is crucial when helping clients who are all in different situations with different problems.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m a big foodie, so on my days off I always like to go out and get food, whether it\u2019s something new or my tried and trusted meals. I often go to different parts of the country to visit some friends and experience what each city is like and the food\ud83d\ude0a.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>I am proud to have recently graduated with a degree, as it was not the easiest thing to have done, but apart from that I need a few more years to do anything of significance!<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Tall, dark, and handsome. I suppose that may be change depending on who you ask.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>Currently watching \u2018Ozark\u2019 on Netflix but I am always watching episodes of its always Sunny in Philadelphia.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>If I had to choose anyone it would be my dad, his work ethic is just something else and he is always around to encourage me in whatever I choose to do.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>When are the 4-day working weeks starting? Not something I have the answer to unfortunately, but I wish I did.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
