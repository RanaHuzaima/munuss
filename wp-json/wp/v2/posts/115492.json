My responsibilities include compiling and filing annual accounts and Self Assessments on behalf of my clients, and also offering tax efficiency advice to them throughout the year.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>I usually start my day responding to emails. I also have initial consultations booked in each day with new clients at 10am and 11am. My afternoon is spent completing accounts and responding to account queries.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Managing my time to ensure I respond to clients promptly, and also keeping up to date with new legislation.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Most recently Brexit, which brought a lot of changes with it. Clients had to quickly adapt to the new legislation that was introduced. Additionally, the pandemic, which has been challenging for all businesses.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I am AAT qualified and continue to grow and refresh my knowledge through CPD, and also learn from the senior accountants that I work closely with. I also have great customer service skills and I am a good communicator. I\u2019m good at simplifying the world of accountancy for my clients so that they understand.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>The variety of clients that we have. It\u2019s great to learn about my clients and their business during our initial consultation. The variation also allows me to grow my knowledge on a daily basis. I also love being part of a great team. Although we each have our own portfolio of clients, we work as a team to ensure that we provide an all-round great service.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>My colleagues. We have a great office atmosphere and I enjoy the relaxed vibe, despite \u2018accountancy\u2019 being a fairly pressurised role. TAP is a great company to work for and we have regular office events that everyone gets involved with. Crystal Maze is the next challenge, followed in September by Tough Mudder!!<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Communication and organisation are definitely key as an accountant. As online accountants we deal with a lot of email queries so it is important that we can communicate clearly and concisely to our clients. We work to deadlines, so of course we need to be extremely organised and plan ahead.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I love to go to the gym and also walk. We are lucky that we live in such a beautiful spot on the Wirral. New Brighton prom is a short walk from my house, and this is definitely one of my favourite places &#8211; colourful skies and brilliant sunsets.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>This would have to be having my son. Parenting is hard work but so fulfilling. It\u2019s certainly been a rollercoaster.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Independent, strong-minded, outgoing, and very active. I am also conscientious and thorough in my work ethic.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t enjoy reading but I love to binge watch almost anything. I am currently binge-watching \u2018This Is Us\u2019 and I am addicted to it.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>My mum. She is amazing, the strongest most \u2018get up and go\u2019 person I know and lives her life to the very fullest, making the most of every opportunity that she is given. We lost my dad 15 years ago to cancer, which was a difficult time for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>Despite this my mum continued on with her adventures and has been a great support to both me, my sister, and her grandkids. There isn\u2019t anything she won\u2019t have a go at. One of her more extreme hobbies is \u2018chilly dipping\u2019 in New Brighton. She really is someone I aspire to be like when I grow older. She\u2019s certainly taught me that life is most definitely for living<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Well, I love my cups of tea and class myself as an expert \u2018brew\u2019 maker. My question would be; Yorkshire Tea or PG Tips? For me, Yorkshire Tea wins hands down!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
