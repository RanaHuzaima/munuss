I offer quotations to our clients for the accountancy services they require.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>Drinking coffee, then replying to emails, texts, phone calls, and live chats from prospective clients. There\u2019s also monthly reporting on sales, and contacting clients who have enquired about our services directly on a daily basis. It\u2019s rather faced paced at times.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Multi-tasking on a very busy day. Plus, sometimes I may get accountancy questions that are more geared towards an accountant. Although I have accountancy knowledge, there are just some questions that need oversight by an accountant.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>COVID-19 probably had one of the bigger impacts on business owners I speak to. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/starting-a-new-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New business owners<\/a> who have never been self-employed or run a business before are now trying to decide on what type of business they should be operating as for the first time. Brexit has also been a challenge, especially with regards to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/what-the-eu-vat-changes-for-e-commerce-mean-for-your-business-90350.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how VAT is now treated from EU countries<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I have previous experience in Sales, which is an advantage with speaking confidently to a lot of clients. Having also worked in accountancy over the past two years has given me more experience in what kinds of services a client may require.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of trying to ascertain what a client needs from an accountant. With accountancy being one of the most important elements of a business, it\u2019s very satisfying knowing you\u2019ve been able to assist a business owner with one of the most vital parts of the business.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>I really like the team I work with. Everyone gets on very well, and is committed to the team itself. TAP also really take care of us by providing lunch and smoothies twice a week! On top of that, TAP are actively assisting staff with their health and general well-being.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Adapting to different enquiries from different types of businesses. It\u2019s sometimes hard to distinguish what is needed for a certain type of business, but asking questions and knowing their situation in slightly more detail goes a long way.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>Liverpool &#8211; I am always there! Whether it\u2019s going for something to eat or rehearsing with my band!<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>Hard to say, but one of them must be when I achieved my black belt in Taekwondo.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Meticulous, and calm under pressure.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>Just finished Squid Game (probably after everyone else). Much better than expected.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>Kevin Parker, better known as Tame Impala. He is a musical genius!<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>This question. Wait&#8230; Did I just answer it?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
