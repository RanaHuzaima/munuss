I will then distribute all emails from the general inboxes to the relevant colleagues. Then I process any registration forms and send out welcome emails to all new clients, and then start answering client emails and queries.<\/p>\n<p>After lunch I submit any confirmation statements that are due, spend time on my daily\/monthly checks, and deal with any internal work.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Forming companies can sometimes be challenging depending on the requirements clients have. It is important to make sure that all the details are correct to prevent any issues further down the line.<\/p>\n<p>As the company is fast paced it can be challenging but also extremely rewarding. I love the fact that everyday is different and we aim to complete every task within a certain time frame to ensure there&#8217;s a quick turn around for clients.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Being new to the accounting world can be very daunting to clients. Running a company is very new to a lot of our clients, and sometimes they need a little bit of guidance about what information they need to provide and what taxes they should be registering for.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I have always worked with the public, and have quickly learnt that being patient and spending time on the little things to give someone a helping hand goes a long way.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>Without a doubt, the people. The office always has such a great vibe. Also, the fact that dogs come into the office during the week is a massive bonus.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>TAP is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. As a colleague you never feel under valued, and you are never made to feel alone with any problems you might face.<\/p>\n<p>We have a lot of amazing perks to the jobs too such as nights out, a gym, chill out room&#8230; the list is endless.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Before TAP I worked in a school. I really feel that teaching has helped me when it comes to training new colleagues and explaining things in a way that is easy to understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>On my days off I love to go on walks with my dog\/friends\/partner down to New Brighton, West Kirby, or to Wales when given the chance.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>My proudest achieve has definitely got be owning my own house at the age of 25.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>I asked this out loud some of my colleagues said calm (I\u2019m not sure they know they real me yet though, haha), straight to the point. I\u2019m hardworking and take a lot of pride in my work no matter what it is. I\u2019m apparently also a good teacher.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>At the moment I am watching the new series of Billions.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>It would have to be my Mum and Dad. During my entire life I have watched them face so many things, and it has rarely affected them and how they go about their day to day life. When I have gone through hard times as an adult, I can quite honestly say if I didn\u2019t have them by my side, I don\u2019t think I would be half the person I am today.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Are Ready Salted an underrated flavour of crisps?
