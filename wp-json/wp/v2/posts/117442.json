This can be general queries, booking in records, requesting authorisation to act on a client\u2019s behalf, answering the phones, registering clients for VAT \/ Self Assessment, registration forms and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company-formations\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">company formations<\/a>.  <\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing I do in the morning is process any registration forms and company formations from the sales team. I then check through my emails to answer any client queries or book in records ready for the accountant to work on. <\/p>\n<p>In the afternoon I work through any checks that I have been given that week. This can be re-requesting authorisation codes, requesting professional clearance, sending invoice reminders, and checking through the BACS report.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>In admin we are always busy and working at a fast pace, which can make it challenging with all the different tasks that need completing. We also set out to reply to clients within 24 hours, which is something I\u2019m always conscious of!<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Each clients\u2019 needs differ, but I usually find clients struggle with registering for different services such as VAT, PAYE, and Self Assessment. For clients it can also be challenging to run the business whilst staying on top of their records, and knowing when to submit their information. We do help this with regular reminders. <\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m good at staying calm in stressful situations, and break problems down in order to manage and resolve them.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019d have to say my favourite part of the job is actually working with my team! Everyone gets on so well which means we are always able to have a laugh alongside working. It\u2019s also really nice when a client has a problem and I\u2019ve been able to help resolve it and put their mind at ease. <\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>I think the best thing would be how social and modern the company is. The staff nights out are a great way for us to get to know each other, especially as it\u2019s such a fast-growing company. Another thing is, as my job is so busy, the days fly by! <\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Organisational skills and time management are really important for my role. I need to be able to plan out my day and week properly to ensure that I have time to complete all my tasks. <\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I usually go to visit my family, or meet with friends to go out for food and drinks. <\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>My proudest achievement would have to be buying my first house on my own at the age of 19. There was a lot more to it than I originally thought and the idea of living by myself was scary (especially as I\u2019m not very good at cooking) but I got there in the end and now I love it! <\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>If you asked them under oath, they\u2019d have to say I was great. Oh, and maybe that I talk too much\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>Recently I\u2019ve started watching Ozark on Netflix, and I constantly have The Office on for an easy watch. <\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>Clich\u00e9, but definitely my mum. I still haven\u2019t figured out how she does it but between her job, and looking after my Nan &#038; Great Aunt, she still has time to help me with anything I need. Nothing is ever too much trouble and she always puts everyone else first. I hope one day I can give as much back to her.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Q. How long until I can retire? <\/p>\n<p>A. 45 years and counting (unless I win the lottery). <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
