It is my responsibility to prepare accounts, tax, and VAT returns for my clients.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>Each day is different from the next, so how I set up my day really depends on whether any deadlines are approaching!<\/p>\n<p>In the morning, I will look to prepare a set of accounts or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax return<\/a>, or VAT returns if we are nearing the 7th. By this point there are usually client emails and queries coming in. <\/p>\n<p>As accountants we also peer review each other\u2019s work to ensure high standards before sending accounts out for clients to approve, so I usually have a few internal reviews to complete. I aim to finish my day having actioned all emails received, and any deadline work completed.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>The constant change in accounting and tax legislation! Especially at the moment. There are a lot of changes and new legislation that we are facing as accountants, such as IR35, Brexit, and various Covid-19 schemes. I have to make sure that I keep myself up to date with any changes and updates to rules, to ensure that I can correctly advise my clients.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Over the last couple of years Covid has really impacted our clients. Whilst some clients unfortunately had to close their companies due to lack of trade, it is nice to see many clients bouncing back now restrictions have been lifted.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I have studied ACCA and ensure I read up regularly on new legislation. I use the knowledge gained from my training as well as from the day-to-day experience of being an accountant. No day is the same and no business is the same, but thanks to my years in practice there aren\u2019t many issues that I haven\u2019t faced.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I enjoy working with such a diverse client base, it always keeps me on my toes and constantly learning new things. Also, being online accountants, our clients really can be based anywhere in the world, which is always interesting<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>The office culture and people. Everyone at TAP is friendly and it\u2019s a happy environment to come into every day. TAP provide us with free lunches and healthy smoothies twice a week as well! <\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Having a large portfolio of clients, my organisational skills come in very handy daily. It is important to have good time management and organisational skills to ensure that I don\u2019t miss any deadlines.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I always enjoy anywhere scenic on the Wirral for a walk, or even a trip to Liverpool or Chester in the sun.  <\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>My proudest achievement is graduating from university. Then I\u2019d say when I finally qualify ACCA in 2022 (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), that will also be my proudest achievement. Both have taken lots of hard work, determination and are a reminder to myself that I can do anything that I put my mind to. <\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Hopefully they would say friendly and approachable!  <\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>The Sopranos but I\u2019ll always have time for Grey\u2019s Anatomy! <\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>My Dad, his job is interesting to hear about and has taken him all over the world. He\u2019s always been hardworking whilst balancing his 3 daughters! <\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Q. Is cheese overrated? <\/p>\n<p>A. YES. \ud83d\ude42<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
