Any business which receives a \u2018notice to deliver a Company Tax Return\u2019 from HMRC must submit one.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>The submission deadline for a Company Tax Return<\/strong> is 12 months after the end of the accounting period which it relates to<\/li>\n<li><strong>The payment deadline for Corporation Tax<\/strong> is 9 months and one day after the end of the accounting period<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The company <em>won\u2019t <\/em>pay Corporation Tax if it makes a loss or isn\u2019t trading, but you <em>will <\/em>need to submit a Company Tax Return to HMRC anyway.

But, like every business decision you face, there are potential drawbacks, too.<\/p>\n<h5>The pros of paying Corporation Tax early<\/h5>\n<p>The overriding benefit of paying early is to receive credit interest &#8211; something which HMRC offer on advance Corporation Tax bill payments. The current rate of credit interest is 0.5%.<\/p>\n<p>HMRC will pay this interest from whenever you pay your bill, up to the standard payment deadline (9 months and one day after the end of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/financial-year-48706.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accounting period<\/a>). They\u2019ll only start paying credit interest from six months and 13 days after the start of the accounting period it relates to though.<\/p>\n<p>Another more general reason for companies paying their tax bill early is simply to get it out the way, and avoid any penalties. However, there are also some things to consider if you do plan to settle your bill early.<\/p>\n<h5>The downsides of paying Corporation Tax early<\/h5>\n<p>The main factor to take into consideration if you do plan on paying your Corporation Tax bill ahead of time is how this will impact your cash flow. Once you dedicate the cash to paying your tax bill, it\u2019s no longer available for use in other parts of the business.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to pick your timing carefully. With 9 months and one day to pay what you owe, make sure you aren\u2019t leaving yourself short within that period.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">take a look at your cash flow forecast<\/a> (yes, we love financial reports!) or ask your accountant. They\u2019ll be able to advise whether paying your Corporation Tax early is a wise move.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that while businesses are eligible to receive credit interest if they pay their tax bill early, this interest counts as income and is therefore subject to tax! You\u2019ll need to record it as such on your company accounts.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Paying your Self Assessment income tax bill<\/h3>\n<p>If you earn some form of income as a UK taxpayer, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll need to pay income tax on it at some point. The income that you receive might be from wages or self-employment, but other forms of income are also subject to income tax. For instance:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Some benefits (including some employment benefits)<\/li>\n<li>Some types of grants<\/li>\n<li>Most pensions<\/li>\n<li>Rental income &#8211; for example <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/do-landlords-pay-tax-60715.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you&#8217;re a landlord<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Untaxed income over \u00a32,500 (e.g., tips)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Income tax allowances<\/h4>\n<p>The good news is that there are several tax allowances available that can help reduce the amount of tax that you pay.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Personal Allowance:<\/strong> You won\u2019t pay tax on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the first \u00a312,570 of your earnings in a tax year<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Trading Allowance:<\/strong> You won\u2019t need to pay tax (or even tell HMRC about it) if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">income from self-employment is less than \u00a31,000<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Dividend Allowance:<\/strong> In 2023\/24 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/paying-tax-on-dividends-in-2022-23-56115.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the dividend allowance<\/a> was \u00a31,000. It reduced to \u00a3500 in the 2024\/25 tax year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The really good news is that you can use more than one of these allowances in the same year. For instance, you could earn \u00a312,000 in wages and receive a \u00a3500 dividend payment, and not pay tax on either.<\/p>\n<h4>How much income tax will I pay?<\/h4>\n<p>Income tax is paid on the basis of taxable income brackets. This means that you\u2019ll pay tax at one rate for any income you earn within one bracket, and then at a different rate for income you earn in the next bracket.<\/p>\n<p>Earning more than the threshold for the next tax bracket doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll pay that rate for all your income \u2013 only on the portion which is above the threshold.
