Maybe you\u2019ve just arrived, ready to start an exciting new chapter of work or study. If so, you might be wondering if non-British citizens are eligible to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bank-accounts\/do-i-need-a-business-bank-account-7561.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">open a UK business bank account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The short answer is usually yes, but although it\u2019s not particularly difficult you\u2019ll need to know a few facts first. Let&#8217;s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a non-resident?<\/h3>\n<p>A non-resident is someone who (either temporarily or permanently) lives in a country that isn\u2019t the one they were born in. Many people move all over the world all the time, for work or study reasons, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/starting-a-new-business\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to set up a business<\/a>, or to be with loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are a UK resident or not is important when it comes to determining your tax status. Sometimes you might be classed as a non-resident for tax purposes, even though you aren\u2019t physically located in the country where you pay tax. An example of this is if you have a permanent address in one country, but your main residence is in a different country.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking of moving to the UK for work or business, it\u2019s recommended you speak to an expert tax advisor beforehand so you\u2019re clear on your position.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our article to learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-residence\/what-is-my-tax-residence-status-241080.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">determining your tax residence status<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>What are the benefits of having a UK bank account?<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to have a UK bank account, and not all UK residents have one. Other money management options include credit unions, National Savings &#038; Investment accounts (which used to be called Post Office Savings accounts), and building societies.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, opening a UK bank account will probably make life much easier for you. You will likely need it to pay your rent or mortgage, as well as your utility bills and any other business or personal payments.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">It\u2019s worth noting that UK limited companies must have a separate business bank account.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nEven if you have bad credit, there are lots of basic accounts you can still apply for, so it\u2019s well worth doing your homework. Big high street names include Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Santander, and NatWest.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I choose the right UK bank account for me?<\/h3>\n<p>Deciding which UK bank account would work best depends on your individual needs and circumstances. There are a few things you need to consider.<\/p>\n<h4>Any monthly fees<\/h4>\n<p>Many UK bank accounts are free of charge, but some come with monthly fees. Often called \u201cpackaged accounts\u201d some banks also offer things like a mobile phone or travel insurance as part of the monthly cost.<\/p>\n<p>Certain savings accounts will also require you to save a fixed amount per month in order to keep the account open &#8211; well worth reading the small print. <\/p>\n<h4>International payments and currency exchange<\/h4>\n<p>If you intend to run a business that takes payment from overseas, or you want to link your account to others abroad, it&#8217;s important to do your homework. It\u2019s a good idea to check international and multi-currency account options alongside international money transfer services.<\/p>\n<h4>Incentives<\/h4>\n<p>Are there any promotions available that are designed to attract new customers? For instance, some banks offer up to \u00a3250 to switch to them.<\/p>\n<h4>Flexibility<\/h4>\n<p>How easy is it to access your money? For example, are the app and mobile banking services simple to use, and are there any branches in the area you\u2019re looking to live or operate in?<\/p>\n<h4>Range of products and services<\/h4>\n<p>What other services does the bank offer? This might be things like credit cards, loans, mortgages, and other business and financial services.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to compare lots of banks and accounts at once, sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comparethemarket.com\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Compare the Market<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moneysupermarket.com\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MoneySupermarket<\/a> can be a good place to start.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How do I open a UK bank account from abroad?<\/h3>\n<p>If you live abroad and want to open a bank account in the UK, you need to prove your identity and residency. You will be asked to give information about your salary or wages and any other sources of income, as well as anything else the bank asks for. <\/p>\n<h4>What documents will I need?<\/h4>\n<p>The exact list of documents the bank needs does vary depending on who the provider is. Some UK banks, such as HSBC and Barclays, will allow you to open a UK bank account even if you\u2019re still living overseas. This can be useful if you want to get it all sorted before your moving date.<\/p>\n<p>Opening an account takes around 10-15 days, but again this varies between banks. Some will let you open an account online, while others will ask you to visit the nearest branch in your home country. You\u2019ll usually need your passport\/ID, proof of income and proof of address.<\/p>\n<p>You may also need to make minimum monthly deposits. Additionally, you might have to provide other documentation such as visa details if you currently live in a non-EU\/EFTA country.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, if you\u2019re planning to start a business remember to have separate business and personal accounts. It\u2019s not a legal requirement for sole traders, but it is strongly recommended. You\u2019ll be glad you did <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-type-of-tax-return-do-i-need-to-submit-2566.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">when it comes to completing tax returns<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>It is difficult to open a bank account in the UK as a new resident?<\/h3>\n<p>One area non-UK residents often find themselves coming unstuck is in proving their address. Many people also stay with relatives for a while after arriving in the UK, which tends to mean they don\u2019t have any rental contracts or household bills in their name.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quick tip:<\/strong> If you\u2019re finding it hard to open a UK bank account due to proof of address issues, some of the online services like <a href=\"https:\/\/monzo.com\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Monzo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.revolut.com\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Revolut<\/a> could help.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019ll still offer you a UK account number and sort code, as well as a debit card which can be used in shops and online, but with less emphasis on proving your address. Each one has different rules though, so read up on what\u2019s available before signing up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Our team offers a wide range of great value accountancy services to suit you.
