After all that hard work to build up your business, it\u2019s more than understandable that you may feel reluctant to let go even if you have positive reasons for doing so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/how-do-i-retire-from-my-own-business-36676.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">such as your approaching retirement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In this article we explain the process for closing down a company, and how this depends on whether or not it\u2019s solvent.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the difference between a solvent and insolvent company?<\/h3>\n<p>An insolvent company is one which is no longer able to afford to pay its bills when they\u2019re due, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/accounting-faqs-what-is-a-liability-64476.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">or it has more liabilities<\/a> (things it must pay, such as debts and salaries) than assets <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/balance-sheet-58501.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on its balance sheet<\/a>. If it is solvent then it can afford to pay its bills, and the company owns more than it owes.<\/p>\n<h4>Is being insolvent the same as being bankrupt?<\/h4>\n<p>The terms <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/what-am-i-allowed-to-do-in-business-if-im-made-bankrupt-56539.html#is-bankruptcy-different-to-liquidation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bankruptcy and insolvency are often used interchangeably to describe financial distress<\/a>, but they do have different meanings. Insolvency is a state where a business is unable to pay its bills. Being declared bankrupt is an official legal process which comes with severe restrictions about borrowing money and running a limited company.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Bankruptcy only applies to individuals and sole traders. Insolvency can apply to any business or individual.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/p6f8tdBel8Y?si=pdDoGP7-4CfJ18f7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>How do I close down a limited company if it\u2019s still solvent?<\/h3>\n<p>A solvent company is one which can still afford to pay its bills, so the owners can close the business either by:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Having the company struck off at Companies House<\/li>\n<li>Applying for member\u2019s voluntary liquidation, where the members of the company (the owners) agree to volunteer for liquidation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Striking off a company to close it<\/h4>\n<p>The most common, and potentially cheapest, way to close a solvent company is to have it struck off the Companies House register. <strong>You can only have a company struck off under certain conditions, and it must not:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/big-cross-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Trade or sell stock within 3 months before closure<\/li>\n<li>Change its name within 3 months prior to closure<\/li>\n<li>Be in financial difficulties, under the threat of liquidation, or have creditors agreements in place<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><em>How do I have my company struck off?<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to apply for company strike off using a DS01 form which has been signed by all of the company\u2019s directors.

The terminology can get a bit confusing because this sounds very similar to a member\u2019s voluntary liquidation (which is when the company <em>can<\/em> afford to pay its debts).<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to call a shareholder\u2019s meeting and have at least 75% of the voting rights agree before you go ahead and appoint an insolvency practitioner to liquidate the company.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">You must inform Companies House that you\u2019re appointing a liquidator within 15 days of the resolution being passed, and advertise this in The Gazette within 14 days.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe practitioner, also known as a liquidator, will arrange to sell off the company&#8217;s assets and share these funds between the creditors before dissolving the company.<\/p>\n<h4>Compulsory liquidation of insolvent companies<\/h4>\n<p>Compulsory liquidation (also known as \u2018winding-up\u2019) is a court procedure which can start by one of your creditors filing a petition for the liquidation of your company. <\/p>\n<p>The application will be reviewed by a judge, who will decide whether a court hearing is necessary or not in order to liquidate the company\u2019s assets before it\u2019s dissolved.  <\/p>\n<h4><em>What can I do to avoid compulsory liquidation for my company?<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>An insolvent company which can\u2019t pay its debts might be able to apply for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). This is a formal agreement to repay the company\u2019s creditors over a set period of time, whilst continuing to trade and keep control of the business.<\/p>\n<p>You will need an insolvency practitioner to work with your creditors and create a CVA for you. They will work out realistic repayments, and invite your creditors to vote on it. To be eligible for a CVA, the arrangement must be approved by creditors who are owed at least 75% of debt.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I close a limited company without a director?<\/h3>\n<p>Limited companies should normally have at least one director in order to operate, but there are times when it can be left without one \u2013 for instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-happens-if-a-director-or-shareholder-dies-199591.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if the sole director dies unexpectedly<\/a>. <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Companies exist as a separate legal entity to the people that own and run them though, so the company won\u2019t automatically close even if this does happen.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThis means that the company will need a new director to be appointed \u2013 either by the remaining shareholders if there are any, or by the executor of the estate. <\/p>\n<p>Companies House will strike the company off the register if it doesn\u2019t appoint a new director, which might sound like an easy option, but it does make dealing with the company\u2019s remaining assets much more difficult.<\/p>\n<h3>What if I don\u2019t want to close it?<\/h3>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to close it, you can let the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dormant-company\/the-difference-between-dormant-and-non-trading-companies-72598.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stop trading and register it as dormant<\/a> for tax reasons, as long as all business activity stops, and it\u2019s not trading or receiving income. You do still need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-annual-accounts-13527.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">send annual accounts<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-is-a-confirmation-statement-91784.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmation statement<\/a> to Companies House though!<\/p>\n<h3>Can I restore my limited company to the register?<\/h3>\n<p>Known as &#8216;administrative restoration&#8217;, you might be able to apply for your company to be restored to the register if:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>You were a company director or shareholder<\/li>\n<li>The company was struck off and dissolved within the last 6 years<\/li>\n<li>It was trading when it was dissolved<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t meet those conditions, you&#8217;ll need to apply for a court order instead. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
