We go over what to consider if you&#8217;re hoping to launch a new venture, and alternative funding options available for low-credit entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<h3>Where should I start?<\/h3>\n<p>There are lots of different reasons for wanting to start a business, so keeping these on your radar can help you stay motivated and make the decisions which best suit your needs. Most startups will need to:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Do some market research<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-write-the-perfect-business-plan-25798.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Write a business plan<\/a> (even if it\u2019s just for you!)<\/li>\n<li>Choose a business structure<\/li>\n<li>Decide what funding support you might need<\/li>\n<li>Keep financial records<\/li>\n<li>Submit tax returns<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It all sounds a bit daunting, but it\u2019s manageable no matter what stage you\u2019re at financially.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-start-a-business-from-scratch-74629.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">starting a business from scratch<\/a> to learn more.<\/div>\n<h3>What business funding can I get with bad credit?<\/h3>\n<p>You might find it more difficult to get a business loan if you have bad or low credit, but there are still a huge variety of funding options available. Some lenders even offer bad credit business loans specifically for company owners whose credit score is affecting their ability to apply for financing.<\/p>\n<p>If the prospect of taking on a loan seems too overwhelming, then alternatives such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/fundraising-and-finance\/crowdfunding-and-tax-for-your-big-idea-136867.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a crowdfunding campaign<\/a> or a business grant could be more suitable. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/fundraising-and-finance\/grants\/are-government-grants-taxable-3823.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Grants can be awarded to businesses<\/a> to help them launch, grow, or for a specific project depending on your needs, and often don\u2019t need to be repaid.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Our article about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/fundraising-and-finance\/funding-options-for-small-businesses-36678.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">different types of business funding<\/a> goes into more detail.<\/div>\n<h3>How do I improve my business credit rating?<\/h3>\n<p>A low credit rating might not necessarily be an issue unless you\u2019re actually looking for credit \u2013 whether that\u2019s from a lender, investor, or even a supplier (in which case they might simply request payment up front). If you are looking for finance, then improving your credit rating will certainly help.<\/p>\n<h4>Review your credit score<\/h4>\n<p>The first step, scary as it might seem, is finding out exactly where you and your business stand in terms of your credit rating. The easiest way to do this is using a credit report service such as Experian, or one of the many others out there.<\/p>\n<p>Your credit score is generated based on your financial history, and references things like payment reliability and dependency on credit. The report will go into detail about which areas need work to help improve your credit score.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/startup-business-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Startup accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only <strike>\u00a354.50<\/strike> \u00a332.70 per month <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Choose the right business structure<\/h4>\n<p>Your legal structure affects the way you set up and operate your business, so it has a big impact. A key consideration here is that sole traders and partners in a partnership aren\u2019t \u2018separated\u2019 from their business, so there\u2019s no distinction between your personal finances and your business\u2019s. <\/p>\n<p>A limited company is a legal entity in its own right, so your personal funds are separate to those of the business.<\/p>\n<p>This means that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/which-legal-structure-should-i-choose-when-i-start-a-business-14385.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the business structure you use to run your business<\/a> can influence what sort of funding is available to you, and the relationship between your own credit score and your business credit rating.<\/p>\n<h4>Keep up to date with payments<\/h4>\n<p>Besides your credit card, make sure that you manage any contracts you have with service providers and vendors. This means making sure you set reminders, and communicate with them when you need to.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s better to avoid legal proceedings where possible, especially if all it takes is a phone call. Having them on your record could damage your ability to get business finance in the future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
