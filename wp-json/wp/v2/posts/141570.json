You\u2019ll need to register for Self Assessment to tell HMRC about your dividend income, and to pay the right amount of tax on it.<\/p>\n<p>It really all boils down to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/paying-yourself-through-your-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how you pay yourself from the company<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>How directors get paid<\/h3>\n<p>In most small companies, the directors are also shareholders (or you might be a sole director and shareholder, doing everything yourself).<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>In your capacity as a director, you can take a salary for your time.

This means <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/whats-the-difference-between-the-national-living-wage-and-the-national-minimum-wage-90465.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">minimum wage doesn\u2019t apply<\/a> and you don\u2019t have to take a salary, but lots of directors do because it gives them a regular source of income.<\/p>\n<p>An important rule to remember though, is that if you do decide to pay yourself a salary for the work you do as a director, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/paye\/understanding-accountancy-terms-pay-as-you-earn-paye-47074.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the payments might need to go through PAYE<\/a>. This depends on how much you pay yourself as a salary.<\/p>\n<p>If it\u2019s less than the Lower Earnings Limit (\u00a36,396 in 2024\/25) then you won\u2019t need to register. If it\u2019s above the limit, then you will.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">What the company cannot do is pay you for holding office as if you\u2019re a self-employed person or through an intermediary company such as a Personal Service Company (PSC).<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nIn short, the company acts as your employer. Any income tax or National Insurance is deducted from your salary, and the company pays it on to HMRC through the PAYE system.<\/p>\n<p>Taxation doesn\u2019t necessarily end there for most directors though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/shareholders\/what-is-a-shareholder-of-a-company-3837.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">because they\u2019re usually also shareholders<\/a>. This means they can take a smaller tax-efficient salary, and then pay themselves dividends.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Our guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-most-tax-efficient-directors-salary-in-2022_23-51622.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tax Efficient Director\u2019s Salaries<\/a> explains this in more detail.<\/div>\n<h5>Do directors need to show their salary on Self Assessment?<\/h5>\n<p>The quick answer is yes. If you do need to submit Self Assessment, it will include sections for each source of income (and how much tax you might already have paid on it, so you won\u2019t be taxed twice). This is so that your total amount of income for the year is taken into consideration, so that you pay the right amount of tax.<\/p>\n<h4>What do dividend payments have to do with directors and Self Assessment?<\/h4>\n<p>Often, directors are also shareholders in the business and as such, they are entitled to receive dividends <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/how-often-can-i-take-dividends-from-my-limited-company-90705.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when the board declares them<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Dividends are paid from the after-tax profits of the company, so this means that they have already suffered some taxation. As a result, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#dividend-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dividend tax is a lower rate than income tax<\/a> (which takes us back to what we mentioned earlier about directors being tax-efficient when they pay themselves).<\/p>\n<h5>Dividend tax rates<\/h5>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" width=\"20%\"><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"25%\"><strong>Threshold<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size: 0.8rem;\">2023\/24<\/b><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"15%\"><strong>Dividend Tax<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size: 0.8rem;\">2023\/24<\/b><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-greyheader\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"25%\"><strong>Threshold<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size: 0.8rem;\">2024\/25<\/b><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-greyheader\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"15%\"><strong>Dividend Tax<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size: 0.8rem;\">2024\/25<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Personal Allowance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Up to \u00a312,570<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">0%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Up to \u00a312,570<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Basic rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a312,571 - \u00a350,270<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">8.75%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a312,571 - \u00a350,270<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">8.75%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Higher rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a350,271 - \u00a3125,140<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">33.75%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a350,271 - \u00a3125,140<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">33.75%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Additional rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a3125,140 upwards<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">39.35%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a3125,140 upwards<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">39.35%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe tax due on dividend payments is paid through Self Assessment rather than being taxed at source like it is for a director\u2019s salary.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to put some money aside from your dividend payments so that you have cash to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/payment-of-self-assessment-tax-2572.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pay your tax bill<\/a>! This is something that sometimes catches people out because they assume that as they are paying PAYE on their salary, then all their tax is taken care of (it isn\u2019t). Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\/dividend-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online dividend tax calculator<\/a> can help you work out what you can expect to pay on this sort of income.<\/p>\n<h3>Self Assessment and directors\u2019 pensions<\/h3>\n<p>The subject of pensions can be hugely complex, but because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/pensions\/getting-started-with-pensions-for-the-self-employed-26994.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pensions attract tax relief<\/a> there are some aspects which crossover into Self Assessment. This is because paying into a pension means that some of the money you would normally pay as tax can go into your pension instead.<\/p>\n<p>What makes it particularly tricky is that there are so many different types of pensions in existence, and this affects the tax. For instance, some pensions are paid:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>As part of the PAYE process, so there won\u2019t normally be any issues with tax<\/li>\n<li>Post-tax, in which case your pension provider will add back an amount to make up for the tax you\u2019ve already paid<\/li>\n<li>Pre-tax, in which case they won\u2019t add anything back<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s strongly advisable that you contact your pension provider to check what type of scheme you are on, to ensure you enter information in your Self Assessment correctly. Otherwise, you may find that you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-happens-if-i-pay-too-much-tax-3729.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">end up paying too much tax<\/a>, or not enough.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefits and gifts<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a director of a company, then you are entitled to some benefits free of tax. You do need to be careful though because there are lots of rules that determine what is and isn\u2019t tax-free.<\/p>\n<p>In general, if a company pays for something that you use personally (called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a benefit in kind or BiK<\/a>) then it will be taxable. On the other hand, there are some things the government feels should be incentivised, and as such won\u2019t attract tax.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/what-are-the-non-taxable-benefits-for-employees-3876.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">your company can pay up to \u00a3500 per year for pensions advice<\/a>, provide you with a mobile phone for personal and business use, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/working-from-home\/working-from-home-expenses-for-limited-companies-238347.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pay you an allowance for working from home<\/a>. If you have other benefits, such as a company car, then you may well have to include them on your tax return. Your company should provide you with a copy of the information it sends to HMRC, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-is-a-p11d-form-31299.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called a P11D<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Director&#8217;s Loan Accounts and Self Assessment<\/h3>\n<p>If you take money out of your limited company which isn\u2019t a salary, dividend, or to reimburse you for an expense, it\u2019s usually considered to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/directors\/what-are-the-tax-implications-of-a-directors-loan-account-184981.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a director\u2019s loan<\/a>. This is fine, as long as the loan account is repaid within 9 months after the end of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/financial-year-48706.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the company\u2019s financial year<\/a>. If it isn&#8217;t, HMRC see it as you taking money out of the business for yourself, so you&#8217;ll need to pay tax on it.<\/p>\n<p>If the director doesn&#8217;t repay the account, or they receive a loan from their company which is interest-free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/can-you-charge-your-company-interest-on-a-loan-from-the-director-14774.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">or has an interest rate below what is available on the open market<\/a>, then the balance might be subject to tax. As a result, you\u2019ll need to declare any outstanding director\u2019s loans on your Self Assessment return.<\/p>\n<h3>Directors and Self Assessment &#8211; what should you do?<\/h3>\n<p>So, if you do need to register for Self Assessment, the first piece of advice is to make sure you do it as soon as possible. This will ensure you don\u2019t face any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/dealing-with-tax-return-penalties-3571.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">penalties for not completing a return<\/a>. Secondly, make sure you save EVERYTHING. Set up a Self Assessment folder on your computer, or ideally in a cloud storage location (like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/free-bookkeeping-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pandle<\/a>) so you don\u2019t lose it if your PC goes into meltdown.<\/p>\n<p>Save hard-copy invoices, receipts, and documentation, and take a photo or scan them and save them to your online folder or cloud storage. Some software providers let you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cloud-accounting-13062.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attach the document to the particular transaction record it relates to<\/a>, which makes things even easier. <\/p>\n<p>We can promise you that doing it as you go along is so much easier than scrabbling around on tax deadline day trying to find things. Have a chat with a professional advisor but do this well before the end of the year as the more time they have to organise things, the better off you\u2019ll be!
