In this article we explain what food expenses you might be able to claim for.<\/p>\n<h3>How does claiming business expenses work?<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses pay tax on the profits they make, rather than the full amount of income they receive. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/profit-and-loss-39421.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">profits are what&#8217;s left over after you deduct any costs and expenses<\/a> from all of your income, so keeping track of your spending is crucial because claiming everything you&#8217;re entitled to means you&#8217;ll pay less tax.<\/p>\n<p>You might also hear the process called &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming expenses<\/a>&#8216; or claiming tax relief.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What are the rules on claiming food and drink expenses?<\/h3>\n<p>The general rule of claiming expenses is that they&#8217;re \u201cwholly and exclusively\u201d for the purpose of doing business. This can mean your food and drink expenses are in a bit of a grey area because everyone needs to eat and drink, whether they run a business or not. <\/p>\n<p>So, you can only claim a meal if it takes place outside of your normal working pattern, and only then if the reason is because of work. <\/p>\n<h4>Can I claim my lunch as a business expense?<\/h4>\n<p>You can, but only if you&#8217;re operating outside of your usual working habits. The most common example is if you need to make &#8220;a business journey outside the normal pattern&#8221;. For instance, someone who normally works from home as a writer could probably claim the cost of a meal during a business trip to meet with their agent.<\/p>\n<p>Your meal might also be eligible if you&#8217;re travelling for business, and the nature of your work means you must travel on a regular basis &#8211; such as a delivery driver. If you&#8217;re staying somewhere overnight on a business trip then you can usually claim the cost of your meal alongside any travel or accommodation expenses.<\/p>\n<h4>A temporary place of work<\/h4>\n<p>It gets a bit more complicated if you&#8217;re travelling to a &#8216;temporary place of work&#8217;, but on a regular basis &#8211; such as visiting your client&#8217;s workplace every day. <\/p>\n<p>If you spend more than 40% of your time there, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/can-my-business-claim-tax-relief-on-travel-expenses-56541.html#the-24-month-rule-for-contractors\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">then you can only claim expenses for up to 24 months<\/a>. So, if you take on a contract to work from your clients&#8217; office for 30 months, it won&#8217;t be classed as temporary, and you won&#8217;t be able to claim.<\/p>\n<h3>How much can I claim?<\/h3>\n<p>HMRC say that you can claim &#8220;reasonable&#8221; expenses for food and drink, although there isn&#8217;t actually a definition as to what might be considered reasonable except to say that \u201celaborate meals with fine wines\u201d don&#8217;t count.
