It doesn\u2019t even matter if the R&#038;D project itself ultimately failed in its objectives, or if the company makes a loss. The main thing is that qualifying R&#038;D work was undertaken, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/guide-to-limited-companies\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the business is a limited company registered for Corporation Tax<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>What R&#038;D costs can I claim for?<\/h3>\n<p>The scope of eligible projects and costs is huge, spanning just about every industry. The key thing here is that your innovation must have involved some kind of scientific or technical uncertainty. It should also benefit the wider field in which your company operates, not just your company itself.<\/p>\n<p>Each R&#038;D project is unique and so are the eligible costs. As a guide these are the most common ones for inclusion:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Staff wages, overtime payments and salaries<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employment-allowance-and-employers-national-insurance-contributions-67362.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employer NIC contributions<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Costs relating to subcontractors, freelancers and externally provided workers (EPWs)<\/li>\n<li>Payments made to volunteers for any clinical trials<\/li>\n<li>Certain types of software (which were specifically designed for the R&#038;D project itself, not bought \u2018off the shelf\u2019)<\/li>\n<li>Consumables (including heat, electricity, and water)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bear in mind this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, which is why it\u2019s well worth seeking advice if you\u2019re thinking of starting an R&#038;D tax relief claim. Innovative companies working in creative industries may also be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/corporation-tax-relief-for-creative-industries-companies-118001.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim creative sector tax reliefs too<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Can I still claim R&#038;D tax relief if the project is unsuccessful?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, even if the project ultimately fails, you can still claim tax relief on behalf of the research and innovation that went into the developmental process.<\/p>\n<h4>R&#038;D relief for overseas EPW and subcontractor costs removed<\/h4>\n<p>In most cases you won\u2019t be able to claim for R&#038;D work carried out after 1st April 2024 by externally provided workers or subcontractors who are located abroad.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions though, and you may still be able to claim tax relief if the work is classed as \u2018qualifying overseas expenditure\u2019 (QOE). For example, if it was unreasonable for the R&#038;D work to be undertaken in the UK. HMRC use the example of placing sensors on a volcano.<\/p>\n<h3>How does R&#038;D tax relief work?<\/h3>\n<p>A successful R&#038;D claim for profit-making companies will be applied as a credit against your bill for Corporation Tax, reducing the amount you need to pay. Loss-making organisations can receive cash payments instead.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Which R&#038;D scheme should I use?<\/h3>\n<p>The R&#038;D tax relief system consists of different schemes depending on the accounting period you\u2019re claiming relief for, and the size of your business.<\/p>\n<h4>Claiming R&#038;D tax relief for accounting periods starting before 1st April 2024<\/h4>\n<p>To claim R&#038;D tax relief for accounting periods starting before April 2024 you\u2019ll need to apply to the correct scheme depending on your eligibility:<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"50%\"><strong>R&#038;D Scheme<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Qualifying Criteria<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>SME scheme<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">\n<ul>\n<li>Employs fewer than 500 people<\/li>\n<li>Has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/balance-sheet-58501.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a balance sheet<\/a> of under \u20ac86 million, or an annual turnover below \u20ac100 million<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) scheme<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">You\u2019ll need to apply using RDEC if your company exceeds these figures, or has received certain notified state aid.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe SME scheme is aimed at smaller businesses whose limited funding might mean they need a bit more financial support to carry out R&#038;D activities. As such, the maximum rate of relief available through the SME R&#038;D scheme is higher than what\u2019s available through the RDEC scheme, which is aimed at larger, more established companies.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">The other crucial difference between the two is the way in which they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accounted for in your bookkeeping<\/a>.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe RDEC scheme is what\u2019s known as an \u2018above the line\u2019 scheme, so any tax credit you receive will be shown as a source of income and therefore subject to Corporation Tax. The SME scheme is \u2018below the line\u2019 so it isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h4><em>How much can I claim through the SME R&#038;D scheme?<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>The SME scheme allows companies to claim tax relief on R&#038;D using an \u2018additional deduction rate\u2019.
