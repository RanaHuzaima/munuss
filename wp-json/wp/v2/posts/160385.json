We\u2019re looking at the emergence of these tokens, what they mean for business, and what your tax position could be if you own, make, or profit from NFTs.<\/p>\n<h3>What is an NFT?<\/h3>\n<p>In simple terms an NFT, or \u2018non-fungible token\u2019, is a unique digital token which represents the ownership of an asset. It\u2019s essentially a digital certificate of ownership rights.<\/p>\n<p>This is recorded on a blockchain, a type of digital ledger shared across a network which stores data as a series (or chain) of blocks. Each block in the chain contains a map of the previous one, linked together using cryptography.<\/p>\n<p>It makes the ability to make changes difficult to the point of improbability, so NFTs and blockchains are considered highly secure.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>What is the difference between fungible and non-fungible assets?<\/h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The term \u2018non-fungible\u2019 refers to an asset which is unique, and can\u2019t be swapped like-for-like, replaced, or duplicated.<\/li>\n<li>Fungible assets cannot be distinguished from one another, and they are easily interchangeable<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A tangible, real-world example of a non-fungible asset might be land, diamonds, or paintings. Their uniqueness means that assessing the value of a non-fungible asset needs a bit more consideration. For example, the sale price of a painting might depend on the artist\u2019s popularity, the rarity of their work, and current trends in the art market. It can even vary depending on the seller, and what they think their customers are willing to pay for it!<\/p>\n<p>In comparison, fungible assets are mostly indistinguishable from each other, so currency is an excellent example. If you were to exchange a \u00a310 note for two \u00a35 notes, the value is the same.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"Non-Fungible Assets\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Non-fungible-assets-infographic.svg\" alt=\"Non-Fungible Assets\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"Fungible Assets\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Fungible-assets-infographic.svg\" alt=\"Fungible Assets\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>What can NFTs be used for?<\/h3>\n<p>NFTs have become a serious business with a wide variety of different uses, such as:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Proof of ownership<\/li>\n<li>Ticketing or access control<\/li>\n<li>As something of value in their own right<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Using NFTs to show proof of ownership<\/h4>\n<p>An NFT can be used as a proxy for the ownership of a specific real-world item such as a car or property. Whilst the person holds an NFT, they really own a physical item of property (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-63218704\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">unless you\u2019re the proud owner of one of Damien Hirst\u2019s NFTs<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>NFTs can also be used for digital items, and any digital asset can be represented, from digital artwork to avatars within a game, collectables, or even the ownership of Tweets. The extent of the marketplace is endless.<\/p>\n<p>A creator or artist will create a smart contract which contains important information relating to the digital works, and in turn, creates an NFT. From that point onwards, purchasers, or \u2018collectors\u2019, are then able to purchase exclusive ownership rights of the digital assets listed on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<h4>Ticketing using NFTs<\/h4>\n<p>Because NFTs are unique they can be used as an access control device. Discord communities are forming that only allow entry if you hold a specific type of NFT. No NFT, and you\u2019re not coming in!<\/p>\n<p>By the same token (pun intended) NFTs are being used as a way to control access to physical events such as concerts or sporting matches. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/music-news\/mariah-carey-nft-songwriters-hall-of-fame-1361982\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mariah Carey recently launched her own NFT<\/a>, with the winner and a guest being entitled to fly on the star\u2019s private jet and dine with their idol.<\/p>\n<h4>Can NFTs have a value in their own right?<\/h4>\n<p>Their very unique nature can mean that owning an NFT is, in its own right, also valuable. NBA TopShot is a good example of where a market has developed purely on the basis of NFT minting and distribution. The owners can regulate the value of types of NFT by only minting certain amounts of each, and thus making the chance of owning one more or less likely.<\/p>\n<p>Gaming is an area where NFTs have also achieved a great deal of traction as a method of distributing value through online gaming platforms in a secure manner.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Online accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>Get a quote and see how much you could be saving!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Get an instant quote<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Buying and selling NFTs<\/h3>\n<p>NFTs can be created, bought, and sold just like any goods and services and this perhaps is a clue to the tax position on these. For instance, if you run a business with a valuable brand and create NFTs that have value for your customers, then it\u2019s much like creating and selling an exclusive line of t-shirts or a music file.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, you can buy these products for use in your business. You might use them as an investment, or a promotional tool, or to give away to customers and staff.<\/p>\n<p>Just like your exclusive line of t-shirts, you need to have a route to market, and like NBA TopShots, you can develop and run your own crypto platform. Admittedly for many companies, the technical expertise and cost will be out of reach, but you could do it. Alternatively, you can use NFT trading platforms or marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>OpenSea, the largest NFT trading platform, is a good example of these but to a very large extent, what you are buying and what you are buying it for will often dictate the marketplace you choose.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I pay tax on NFTs?<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to tax on NFTs, the easiest thing to do is forget they&#8217;re crypto assets and think of them as something more conventional, such as a car or house. At this point though, it&#8217;s crucial to understand that NFTs aren\u2019t protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, so anything you invest could all be lost.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The way you pay tax on NFTs is pretty much the same as any other asset or income<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor example, if you\u2019re an artist and sell your work through your own limited company, you could decide to produce NFTs and sell these through your company. Any business profits will be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subject to Corporation Tax<\/a> in the same way they normally would, and in turn anything you decide to pay yourself from the business will also be taxed in the usual way.<\/p>\n<p>Another example could be if you \u2018dispose\u2019 of an NFT \u2013 such as by selling it, gifting it to someone else or swapping it, or using the NFT to pay for goods or services. Just like any other asset, this might mean that you\u2019re liable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/the-basics-of-capital-gains-tax-45500.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to pay Capital Gains Tax<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you buy and sell them, or use them in your business, then there may be a tax charge. HMRC list more details about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/hmrc-internal-manuals\/cryptoassets-manual\/crypto40000\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax of crypto assets for business<\/a> in their manual.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Tax isn\u2019t an easy subject to understand, so if you\u2019d like to chat to the team call 020 3355 4047 or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor:
