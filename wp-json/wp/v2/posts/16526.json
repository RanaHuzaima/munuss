As an employer you may be able to reimburse those costs, but there are strict rules about what you can provide to employees without them needing to pay additional tax. <\/p>\n<p>In this article we&#8217;ll go over what expenses you can pay back to employees, when they might need to pay tax, and the importance of creating an employee expense policy.<\/p>\n<h3>What expenses can I reimburse an employee for?<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s up to you what payments you make to your employees, but there might be tax to pay if you cover expenses which aren&#8217;t &#8220;wholly and exclusively&#8221; related to work and a necessary part of the job.<\/p>\n<p>Paying an employee for expenses outside of this might see it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">classed as a benefit in kind<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Your employee will pay extra tax on the value of what they receive<\/li>\n<li>As an employer you&#8217;ll still be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim tax relief on the expense<\/a>, but you&#8217;ll also need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employment-allowance-and-employers-national-insurance-contributions-67362.html#what-is-employers-national-insurance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">make National Insurance contributions on it<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What qualifies as a business expense for employees?<\/h4>\n<p>The rules around what your employees can treat as an allowable expense for work without incurring extra tax cover five broad points. If you&#8217;ve arrived here fresh from doing battle with HMRC&#8217;s tax manuals, we&#8217;ll give HMRC&#8217;s definition, and then explain what it means!<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>The expense must be one that each and every holder of that employment would have to incur<\/h4>\n<p><strong>It doesn&#8217;t relate to a specific employee, and would have been incurred by <em>anyone<\/em> doing that job.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HMRC use the example of someone working in a chemical factory who finds the standard issue overalls uncomfortable so buys their own. In this scenario the employer already provides protective clothing, so reimbursing the employee for the cost of organising their own would be classed as a benefit in kind.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>The expense must be necessarily incurred<\/h4>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s an essential expense in order for the employee to carry out their work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As long as it&#8217;s a necessary expense, you&#8217;re not restricted to using the cheapest option available. For example, a business trip which is possible by either train or by air. Either option can be claimed in full as long as the trip is needed for work &#8211; regardless of whether one option is cheaper than the other.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>The expense must be incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment<\/h4>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s a direct result of your employee carrying out their job<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This means it&#8217;s not just an expense which is relevant to their work, it must be a direct result of them performing that role. HMRC give the example of a journalist who buys newspapers to read. It helps them broaden their knowledge and carry out their role efficiently, but it&#8217;s not a cost incurred in order to perform those duties.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>The expense must be incurred and paid<\/h4>\n<p><strong>The total amount of expenses shouldn&#8217;t be more than the total earnings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HMRC say that a deduction for employees&#8217; expenses can only take place if an actual expense has been incurred and paid. If the total amount of expenses incurred in a tax year (from 6th April to 5th April) is more than the total earnings in the same period of time, you can&#8217;t claim a tax refund on the difference.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>The expense must be wholly and exclusively so incurred<\/h4>\n<p><strong>It doesn&#8217;t count if the expense has a dual purpose &#8211; for both business and non-business use (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/can-my-business-claim-tax-relief-on-travel-expenses-56541.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">although this doesn&#8217;t apply to travel expenses<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HMRC don&#8217;t allow business expenses which include personal (dual) usage, so you&#8217;ll only be able to make a claim if you can work out the part which relates to the business &#8211; otherwise you won&#8217;t be able to claim for any of it. <\/p>\n<p>The most common example of this is clothing. If it&#8217;s something you can wear to work, the shops, or on the school run, then it has dual purpose so you won&#8217;t be able to claim for it. Even if it&#8217;s only ever worn for work, it still has the potential to be dual usage so it&#8217;s not an allowable expense. Although you might be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/can-clothes-be-claimed-for-as-a-business-expense-43138.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"<a style=\"color: #3669A4; text-decoration: underline;\">claim expenses for branded uniforms, costumes, and protective clothing<\/a>!<\/div>\n<p>If your employee is entitled to a uniform or clothing expenses, they might also be able to claim tax relief for washing and maintenance costs towards it. This is usually dealt with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-is-the-1263l-tax-code-242771.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">through their tax code<\/a>, so you might see a change!<\/p>\n<h3>Can my employee claim expenses from HMRC?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, although your employees <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/tax-relief-for-the-self-employed-3833.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">can&#8217;t claim tax relief on the same thing twice<\/a>, so if you&#8217;ve already reimbursed them for something then they can&#8217;t claim for it again. Their claim depends on what they do for work. For example, if they&#8217;re required to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/flexible-working-for-employers-5132.html#what-expenses-allowances-can-an-employee-claim-if-they-work-from-home\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">work from home your employees may be able to claim some of the cost<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>They can make their claim using a P87 form as long as they:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/paye\/understanding-accountancy-terms-pay-as-you-earn-paye-47074.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pay tax through PAYE<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Haven\u2019t filled out a Self Assessment <\/li>\n<li>Are owed less than \u00a32,500<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If they don&#8217;t satisfy all those criteria, they&#8217;ll need to submit a Self Assessment tax return and include the claim.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/outsourced-payroll-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Complete managed payroll service<\/h3>\n<p>From just \u00a36.00 per payslip<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Do I need an expenses policy for employees?<\/h3>\n<p>Having a policy for managing employee expenses in place will make the process easier, more consistent, and can help protect your business from fraudulent claims.
