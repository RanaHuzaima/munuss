The changes mean that companies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#CorpTax\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">will pay Corporation Tax<\/a> based on their reported profits:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Companies with profits up to \u00a350,000 will continue to pay Corporation Tax at 19%<\/li>\n<li>The rate increases to 25% for companies reporting profits over \u00a3250,000<\/li>\n<li>Marginal relief will provide a gradual tax rate increase for those falling between the two<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corporation Tax and Marginal Relief<\/a> in our article.<\/div>\n<h3>R&#038;D changes<\/h3>\n<p>R&#038;D tax credits give tax relief to businesses on the cost of their research and development expenses. There are two versions of the scheme, both of which will be updated from April 2023:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) scheme:<\/strong> Aimed at larger businesses, the rate of tax relief available will increase from 13% to 20%<\/li>\n<li><strong>SME scheme:<\/strong> The enhancement that smaller business can claim will reduce from 130% to 86%. However, eligible loss-making research-intensive businesses spending more than 40% of their total expenditure on R&#038;D could claim \u00a327 for every \u00a3100 they spend on R&#038;D<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our article to learn more about the changes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/rd-tax-relief-for-businesses-14241.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">R&#038;D Tax Relief<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>Changes to Capital Allowances<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/the-beginners-guide-to-capital-allowances-127149.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Capital Allowances are a type of tax relief that companies can claim<\/a> against the cost of investing in long-term business assets. <\/p>\n<p>There are already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/different-types-of-capital-allowances-127089.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">different types of Capital Allowances<\/a> available, but with the heroically named super-deduction due to end in March 2023, the government have announced new measures to replace it.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Full Expensing (FE):<\/strong> This means that between 1st April 2023 and 31st March 2026 businesses can deduct 100% of the cost of some main-rate plant and machinery from their profits before tax.<\/li>\n<li><strong>50% first-year allowance for special rate assets:(FYA)<\/strong> Taxpayers can deduct 50% of the cost of assets that would normally fall into the special rate pool. This scheme was originally introduced alongside the super-deduction, but the government are now extending it until 31st March 2026.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Updates to free childcare<\/h3>\n<p>In the hope of helping some parents with costs, the Chancellor announced new measures for free childcare in England. Equivalent funding is expected to be announced for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>Under the current rules, children aged three and four are eligible for 30 hours of free childcare each week, and this will now be extended to include children over the age of 9 months, with effect from April 2024.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy prices<\/h3>\n<p>The cap on household energy bills was due to increase in April 2023, but the Energy Price Guarantee has now been extended at the current level until the end of June 2023, limiting the bill for a typical household to \u00a32,500. It might offer some protection if you run your business from home, but remember you can only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/working-from-home\/do-you-work-from-home-heres-what-you-can-claim-for-44980.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim tax relief on the portion of your bills<\/a> relating to the business. <\/p>\n<p>For eligible businesses and other non-domestic users the Energy Bills Discount Scheme will replace <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/cost-of-living-and-business\/what-help-can-i-get-if-my-business-cant-pay-its-energy-bills-168623.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Energy Bill Relief Scheme<\/a>. It offers support for high energy bills until 31 March 2024, and for those businesses operating in sectors which require high levels of energy use in particular.<\/p>\n<h3>Private pensions<\/h3>\n<p>Without a workplace pension to pay into, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/getting-started-with-pensions-for-the-self-employed-26994.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lots of self-employed people rely on private pensions<\/a> to help them prepare for the future. It can be a tax-efficient way to save, with the Government offering tax relief on private pension contributions. <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The amount you can save into your pension pot in a tax year before starting to pay tax is currently \u00a340,000. Known as the annual tax-free pension allowance, the threshold will increase to \u00a360,000 from April 2023.<\/li>\n<li>Under current rules you&#8217;ll also normally pay tax if your pension pot goes above the lifetime allowance of \u00a31,073,100.
