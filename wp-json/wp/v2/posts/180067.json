Although there\u2019s no specific UK cryptocurrency tax, you may still need to pay tax on any earnings you receive. In this article, we\u2019ll look at what all this means, how much tax you might need to pay, and who to tell about it.<\/p>\n<h3>When do I need to pay income tax on my crypto?<\/h3>\n<p>Earning cryptocurrency in the UK will attract National Insurance and income tax exactly like any other income. This includes if your employer pays you in crypto, or if you receive rewards for mining cryptocurrency. <\/p>\n<p>There are three other reasons why you may need to pay income tax on your crypto:<\/p>\n<h4>1. Trading crypto<\/h4>\n<p>There\u2019s no clear HMRC guidance on this but if you\u2019re making organised, regular profit from trading crypto then income tax will likely be due. When you exchange your crypto for Sterling, you may also need to pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/the-basics-of-capital-gains-tax-45500.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Capital Gains Tax<\/a> on any profit.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Receiving airdrops<\/h4>\n<p>Sometimes you may receive airdropped crypto as a reward for undertaking a particular service. As this is treated as miscellaneous income it may, again, be subject to tax.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Staking for crypto<\/h4>\n<p>Any tokens you\u2019re given from staking crypto is also miscellaneous income and could be taxed.<\/p>\n<h3>How much income tax will I have to pay on UK crypto?<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone in the UK <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">can earn up to \u00a312,570 in a tax year<\/a> before they need to pay tax. So, if your total earnings in a tax year take you over this threshold &#8211; for example because you have a day job, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/do-landlords-pay-tax-60715.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rent out property<\/a>, earn money from crypto, or have pension income &#8211; you\u2019ll need to start paying income tax too. <\/p>\n<h4>How do I work out crypto tax?<\/h4>\n<p>To work out how much tax you\u2019ll need to pay on your crypto, you first need to calculate how much it was worth on the open market at the specific time and date you received it &#8211; the Fair Market Value (FMV). This will help you see its value in Pounds Sterling. There are several UK crypto tax calculators you can use online to do this.<\/p>\n<h4>What rate of tax will I need to pay?<\/h4>\n<p>Once you convert your crypto currency into British Pounds, you can add it to any other income you receive to work out the total for the year. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#income-tax\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rate of income tax that you pay<\/a> depends on how much of your income falls into each tax bracket.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You may also need to pay Capital Gains Tax \u2013 which we\u2019ll explain in the next section.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This table shows the tax rates for taxpayers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

So, if you make less than this in crypto profit you aren\u2019t required to report your crypto profits or pay CGT. Do, however, bear in mind that you may still need to pay income tax if you\u2019ve exceeded the personal tax threshold as we\u2019ve discussed above.<\/p>\n<p>You might also still need to pay Capital Gains Tax on your crypto profits if any of the below apply to you:<\/p>\n<h4>Using crypto to buy goods and services<\/h4>\n<p>In this case, you may need to pay Capital Gains Tax on any profits you generated between the time it was bought and the time it was spent. This is regardless of whether your profits were made over 5 years or 5 hours &#8211; the tax will remain the same.<\/p>\n<h4>Selling crypto in exchange for Pounds<\/h4>\n<p>Selling your crypto so you can receive GBP in return means you may well need to pay Capital Gains Tax on any profit you make.<\/p>\n<h4>Gifting crypto (except to your spouse or civil partner)<\/h4>\n<p>Giving your crypto away to someone else may also mean you need to pay Capital Gains Tax on any profit made between acquiring it and giving it away. This doesn\u2019t apply if you\u2019re gifting it to your spouse or civil partner.<\/p>\n<h4>Swapping crypto for crypto<\/h4>\n<p>Again, you\u2019ll need to pay Capital Gains Tax on any profits made between when you bought the original token and when you swapped it.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How do I calculate how much Capital Gains Tax I\u2019ll pay on my UK crypto profit?<\/h3>\n<p>A good place to start is by going through all your transactions to see which ones will actually attract Capital Gains Tax. You will then need to work out the profit (or the \u201cgain\u201d) you made.<\/p>\n<h4>Calculate the cost basis for each crypto transaction<\/h4>\n<p>This is essentially how much you paid for your crypto, in addition to any transaction fees. For example, you pay \u00a320,000 for 1 Bitcoin and pay \u00a3150 in transaction fees. This means your cost basis is \u00a320,150.<\/p>\n<h4>Work out the gain that you made<\/h4>\n<p>You sell your 1 Bitcoin for \u00a330,000 (so this is the value of your crypto at the time and date you gifted, swapped, spent, or sold it). Deduct the cost basis from this value. In this case your calculation is \u00a330,000 &#8211; \u00a320,150, so your profit (the \u201cgain\u201d) is \u00a39,850.<\/p>\n<h4>Deduct the tax-free allowance for Capital Gains Tax<\/h4>\n<p>In 2024\/25 this is \u00a33,000. \u00a39,850 minus \u00a33,000 is \u00a36,850. <strong>You\u2019ll pay Capital Gains Tax on \u00a36,850<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4>How much tax you\u2019ll pay on the gain<\/h4>\n<p>The rate of tax that you\u2019ll pay on the gain depends on which band your total income for the year falls into.<\/p>\n<p>In this example, you earn \u00a360,000 from an employer in addition to the \u00a39,850 gain you make from crypto. Your total income for the year is \u00a369,850, which puts your total earnings into the higher rate of income tax bracket.<\/p>\n<p>Capital Gains are taxed depending on whether they\u2019re made from residential property or another type of asset. In this case, crypto falls into the second category.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Type of taxpayer<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rate of Capital Gains Tax for other chargeable assets<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\">Basic rate taxpayer<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">10%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Higher rate taxpayers<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">20%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nAs a higher rate taxpayer, you\u2019ll pay 20% tax on the taxable gain of \u00a36,850. Your bill for CGT will be \u00a31,370.<\/p>\n<h3>I\u2019ve made a loss on my crypto currency. What does this mean for tax?<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll only pay tax on the &#8216;profit&#8217; or &#8216;gain&#8217; you make, rather than the actual income itself, so you won&#8217;t pay tax on any losses from disposing of your crypto. It&#8217;s also worth noting you can carry these losses forward and offset them against future gains for up to four years from the end of the tax year they occurred.<\/p>\n<h3>When will crypto transactions not be subject to tax?<\/h3>\n<p>In certain cases, no income tax or Capital Gains Tax will need to be paid on your crypto transactions at all. This would be the case if you\u2019re:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Transferring your crypto between wallets that are both owned by you<\/li>\n<li>Buying crypto with fiat currency.
