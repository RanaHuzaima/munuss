The good news is there <em>are<\/em> valid reasons to split your business, which HMRC would find acceptable. You just need to prove the reasoning &#8211; which we\u2019ll discuss in this article.  <\/p>\n<h3>What is the VAT registration threshold?<\/h3>\n<p>If your business has a taxable turnover of \u00a390,000 per year or more, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-do-i-register-for-vat-our-guide-to-vat-registration-93406.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register it for VAT<\/a>. Short for Value Added Tax, VAT is a sales tax which VAT registered business owners add onto the sale of eligible products and services. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/vat-notice-7001-should-i-be-registered-for-vat\/vat-notice-7001-should-i-be-registered-for-vat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Some businesses and services are exempt from VAT<\/a>, for example, fundraising events run by charities or services from doctors and dentists. <\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CAzN5Gt3CtY?si=lYVnv7olLzbqmA5i\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Why do some businesses try to avoid registering for VAT?<\/h3>\n<p>Some business owners will set out to artificially separate an existing business into two or more separate businesses as a way to distribute their earnings so that they can avoid surpassing the VAT registration threshold (\u00a390,000). If this threshold is <em>not<\/em> surpassed, businesses can avoid VAT registration and potentially gain a competitive edge. <\/p>\n<p>Adding VAT to sales <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-could-registering-for-vat-affect-my-pricing-60729.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">makes your products or services seem more expensive<\/a>, which in turn can make them less appealing to clients and customers \u2013 impacting on turnover. <\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>For example<\/h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you have a beauty store that sells cosmetics and perfume. You\u2019ve grown as a business, and your taxable sales are over the VAT threshold, meaning most of your goods are now subject to the standard rate of 20%. Suddenly, a perfume costing \u00a320 retails for \u00a324.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This might be enough to put off some customers, but if you deal with other businesses that aren\u2019t VAT registered, they won\u2019t be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/how-do-i-reclaim-vat-132750.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reclaim any of the added VAT<\/a> back. This can have a big impact on their income and force them to look elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Some businesses offer their customers discount codes before increasing the prices, alerting them about the changes and why they\u2019re happening so there are no surprises! <\/p>\n<h4>Submitting MTD VAT returns<\/h4>\n<p>Another aspect of VAT registration that tends to put people off is the idea of any extra admin because VAT registered businesses are subject to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/making-tax-digital-for-vat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Making Tax Digital (MTD) VAT rules<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In practise this means you must keep digital records of all your business transactions as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/how-do-i-submit-a-vat-return-14690.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">making VAT submissions to HMRC throughout the year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It might seem daunting, but if you use good bookkeeping software, you\u2019ll be able to keep track of this stuff much more easily. Given both points, it makes sense that artificially  splitting a business might be tempting, but as far as HMRC are concerned, it\u2019s fraud.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/vat-return-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive VAT return service<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a340.00 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Can I split my business into two for other reasons?<\/h3>\n<p>To split your business in two (or more) parts, you\u2019ll need to prove there\u2019s a legitimate reason for it.  This means HMRC needs sufficient evidence from you that there\u2019s no financial, economic, or organisational link between the separate parts.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019ve split your business then HMRC may check whether the new structures:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Use the same bank account<\/li>\n<li>Have the same financial interests<\/li>\n<li>Are financially dependent on one another<\/li>\n<li>Have staff who work in the same office space, and use the same equipment<\/li>\n<li>Use joint advertisements \u2013 for example, one company puts roles up on sites like Indeed to split candidates between both businesses, or they use paid ads on social media that display the services of both<\/li>\n<li>Have the same employees and manager <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>How do I make sure my business is split properly?<\/h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Have separate bank accounts for each business, along with separate business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">records<\/a><\/li>\n<li>If customers buy from both businesses, they must believe they are dealing with two separate entities <\/li>\n<li>Each business is registered independently with HMRC, and sends their own tax returns <\/li>\n<li>There are different managers and supervisors for each business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are some clear, distinct reasons to have two different businesses, such as a scaffolder who decides they also want to open their own bakery. It\u2019s clear the businesses have nothing to do with one another, and that they\u2019re not looking to avoid VAT by separating. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s more likely to be a lot less clear cut than this though and it\u2019s well worth chatting to an accountant or advisor to make sure you\u2019re making the best decision.  Always ensure you have evidence to prove there\u2019s validity in why you\u2019ve split your business \u2013 and remember, avoiding VAT is most definitely not a reason. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>If you have any questions about disaggregation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/vat-return-services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">or need help with VAT<\/a>, talk to one of the team on 020 3355 4047, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online. <\/em><\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you \u2018disaggregate\u2019 something, you split it up into different parts or components, such as breaking a company into distinct and independent&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":64,"featured_media":198017,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[586],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What is Disaggregation (Artificial Separation) of a Business for VAT?
