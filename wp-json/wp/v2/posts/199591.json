A director takes a more \u2018hands-on\u2019 role within the business \u2013 taking on tasks such as managing the team, employing staff, managing payroll, and registering for VAT. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our article to learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-difference-between-a-shareholder-and-a-director-40226.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the difference between shareholders and directors<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>What is the role of a shareholder?<\/h4>\n<p>This depends on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/shares\/how-and-when-are-shares-created-179597.html#what-types-of-shares-are-there\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the type of shares<\/a> the members own.

They usually have more responsibilities than shareholders do, and must ensure everything runs smoothly. Typical duties involve:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Looking after payroll<\/li>\n<li>Hiring staff (and on some occasions letting staff go)<\/li>\n<li>Submitting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Company Tax Returns and paying Corporation Tax<\/a> on time<\/li>\n<li>Managing staff and other resources<\/li>\n<li>Organising things such as shareholders\u2019 meetings (basically ensuring shareholders have regular updates on the how the investments they\u2019ve made are performing).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What happens if a shareholder dies?<\/h3>\n<p>If the shareholder is the only person who owns their shares, they&#8217;ll pass onto their personal representative or &#8216;executor&#8217; in a process known as transmission. The executor is responsible for carrying out the instructions in the will if there is one, and handling the deceased&#8217;s possessions, bank accounts, and any shares. <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">If you own joint shares and your partner dies, you will automatically have the title to the shares.<\/div>\n<h4>Where does the articles of association and shareholders\u2019 agreement come into this?<\/h4>\n<p>There may be a shareholder&#8217;s agreement or provisions in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-model-articles-of-association-in-a-limited-company-196848.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the company&#8217;s articles of association<\/a> (the rules which set out how the company should be run) which affect what happens with the shares.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases the articles will acknowledge someone&#8217;s right to inherit the shares, but without granting them the right to vote or attend meetings unless they register.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>Why do companies do that?<\/h4>\n<p>Someone might inherit shares despite having very little knowledge (or interest) about the business or industry. In this case, it\u2019s probably not the best idea to put them in the hot seat making key business decisions!\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately, situations like this can cause issues, but there are things that you can do to minimise the risk of clashes with other shareholders, and disruption to your business. <\/p>\n<p>For instance, making your shares &#8216;compulsory transfers&#8217; means the company can buy them back or sell them to existing shareholders upon the death of the shareholder in question. <\/p>\n<h4>Paying tax if you inherit shares<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth making sure that the new shareholder understands their taxpaying responsibilities if they receive money as a result of inheriting them. For instance, if they sell the shares, or receive dividends and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/paying-tax-on-dividends-in-2022-23-56115.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">need to pay dividend tax<\/a>.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What happens if a director dies?<\/h3>\n<p>There are two scenarios for this type of situation, depending on whether or not there are other directors in the business.<\/p>\n<h4>There are still existing directors<\/h4>\n<p>If there are other surviving directors, they can normally continue running things as normal, sharing out the deceased director\u2019s responsibilities &#8211; as long as the company&#8217;s articles of association allow it. Some companies require a minimum number of directors, in which case a new director will need to be appointed. <\/p>\n<h4>The sole director has died<\/h4>\n<p>A private company must have at least one &#8216;natural&#8217; (human) director in order to be compliant with Companies House rules. If this person dies but there are other shareholders, they can hold a meeting to appoint a new company director or put themselves forward for the role. <\/p>\n<h3>What happens if the deceased director was also the only shareholder?<\/h3>\n<p>This is an incredibly unfortunate situation, with two outcomes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/how-to-register-as-a-limited-company-in-the-uk-60721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">depending on when the business was incorporated<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>If the company was incorporated before 2009, the personal representative of the deceased will need to seek a court order to appoint a new director. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s much easier if the company was incorporated after 2009. The personal representative can appoint a new director, which is much less costly than going to court. <\/p>\n<p>If this seems too complicated, you can always revisit your articles to make more flexible arrangements \u2013 or, better yet, appoint a second director.<\/p>\n<h3>What should I do next?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re the sole director of your company and operate under the Table A articles of the 1985 Companies Act, reviewing and amending shareholder\u2019s agreements to ensure your family, friends, and fellow shareholders don\u2019t suffer the burden is crucial. <\/p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t fall under those categories, take a look at what you have in place, and amend where needed to offer more flexibility if anything were to happen. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>If you have any questions regarding what happens next, talk to the team on 020 3355 4047 or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re planning to start a business, it&#8217;s really important to ensure you cover everything, including all the potential what-ifs.
