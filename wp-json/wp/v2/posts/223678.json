This isn\u2019t for everyone, and there are specific requirements you\u2019ll need to tick off first, so we\u2019ll look at who qualifies, and how it works. <\/p>\n<h3>What is PAYE?<\/h3>\n<p>PAYE stands for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/paye\/understanding-accountancy-terms-pay-as-you-earn-paye-47074.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pay As You Earn<\/a>, which is the system employers use to deduct tax and National Insurance from employees each time they pay them. The amount they need to deduct depends on how much the employee earns, any tax allowances they&#8217;re entitled to, and what tax code they&#8217;re on.<\/p>\n<h4>How do tax codes work?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/income-tax\/what-is-a-tax-code-14789.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding your tax code<\/a> may be confusing at first, as it\u2019s just a series of numbers and letters. The letters usually refer to any tax allowances you&#8217;re entitled to, or whether you\u2019re paying emergency tax (which can happen if it&#8217;s unclear what tax code you should be on, so you get \u2018emergency taxed\u2019 instead &#8211; usually paying <em>too<\/em> much tax, so speak with HMRC to get this fixed!). <\/p>\n<p>The most common letter is L, which means you qualify for the normal amount of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax-free personal allowance<\/a>. The numbers indicate how much tax-free you&#8217;re entitled to for that tax year. <\/p>\n<h3>How is my Self Assessment payment collected through PAYE?<\/h3>\n<p>Your Self Assessment tax return form will (normally) automatically default to the option which allows HMRC to collect the tax you owe through your tax code, but you can opt out of this by unchecking the box.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt in, your employer will be notified by HMRC that your tax code has changed, and this new tax code will tell them how much to deduct from your wages each time they pay you. The deductions which HMRC tell them to make will cover what you owe after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submitting your Self Assessment tax return<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">They&#8217;ll be made in addition to what your employer normally deducts for the tax you owe on your wages.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThis change to your tax code might give your employer reason to suspect that you have another source of income &#8211; which is something to consider if you don&#8217;t want them know about a side-hustle! <\/p>\n<p>The tax you owe for Self Assessment will be deducted from your salary or pension in equal installments, similar to income tax or National Insurance payments. It\u2019s spread out over twelve months, so you don\u2019t need to pay up all at once!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Self Assessment tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What are the criteria for paying my tax bill through my PAYE tax code? <\/h3>\n<p>To pay your tax bill through your PAYE tax code, you\u2019ll need to meet all three conditions set by HMRC:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>You owe less than \u00a33,000 on your tax bill (if your tax bill is higher than \u00a33,000, you can&#8217;t make a partial payment to bring it below the threshold for PAYE)<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re an employee or you have a company pension, so you already have a PAYE tax code that you pay tax from<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ve submitted your tax return either using the paper form by 31st October or your online tax return by 30th December.
