Where do you even start?!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve found yourself in this situation, it\u2019s good to know you\u2019re not alone. Statistics show that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/english-private-landlord-survey-2021-main-report\/english-private-landlord-survey-2021-main-report--2#chapter-1-profile-of-private-landlords\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">35% of landlords in England originally bought their property for themselves<\/a>, and 7% inherited property from a loved one. While some of those might have planned to let out their home <em>eventually<\/em>, with the rising cost of living many have become landlords through no choice of their own. <\/p>\n<h3>What is an accidental landlord? <\/h3>\n<p>Accidental landlords usually rent out their property due to unforeseen circumstances, rather than actively acquiring a property with the intention of becoming a landlord. For example, they might have found themselves in possession of a home that&#8217;s not selling and they&#8217;re moving away or moving into their partner&#8217;s home.<\/p>\n<h4>How do you become an accidental landlord?<\/h4>\n<p>You can become an accidental landlord for a number of reasons, but a few common ones are:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>You can\u2019t sell your home (usually due to things like the cost of living or rising mortgage rates) so you rent it out instead <\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ve moved into a partner&#8217;s home and now have a \u2018spare\u2019 house<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ve inherited a property <\/li>\n<li>House prices put you off selling your property for the time being<\/li>\n<li>You move overseas or travel for work and want to keep your home as an asset <\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ve decided to earn some extra income, or want to cover the cost of the mortgage whilst the property increases in value<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are likely to be more reasons we\u2019ve missed off our list. Basically, an \u2018accidental\u2019 landlord means you had no original plans to rent out your property or become a landlord in any way, shape, or form \u2013 it just happened! <\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to register as a landlord in the UK? <\/h3>\n<p>This depends on where you\u2019re based, and rules vary across the UK.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"30%\"><strong>Country<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"70%\"><strong>Do you need to register as a landlord?<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">England<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">You don\u2019t need to register to be a landlord in England, but you may need to pay a fee to your local authority depending on where you\u2019re based.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Northern Ireland<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">You\u2019re required to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nidirect.gov.uk\/services\/register-landlord-or-renew-your-landlord-registration\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">register as a landlord in Northern Ireland<\/a>.

Many landlords prefer to own their properties through a limited company because in can sometimes be a more tax-efficient option, and can protect you against higher rates of tax, especially if you have another source of income. <\/p>\n<p>It also means limited liability, so if you run into financial issues you may not have to be in debt personally, unlike a sole trader who has unlimited liability and whose assets could be at risk in order to settle the debt. <\/p>\n<p>Landlords still own properties successfully as a sole trader though too, and it does have some benefits. For example, you can obtain a buy-to-let mortgage much more easily than you can through a limited company, and all the profits you make are yours. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/should-i-own-my-property-through-a-limited-company-or-as-a-sole-trader-97458.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">owning property through a Limited Company, or as a Sole Trader<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>How should I rent out my property?<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no correct answer when it comes to this question, it really depends on what you\u2019re looking to get out of it, and what you\u2019re willing to put in.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you might offer it out as a short-term holiday let, to guests staying anywhere from one night to two weeks, or you might prefer something more long-term and rent it out under an Assured Tenancy Agreement (usually with a minimum term of 6 to 12 months which can then be renewed). <\/p>\n<p>A holiday-let can be a lot of hard work and will need to be available for bookings for a minimum of 210 days per year <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/a-tax-guide-for-furnished-holiday-lettings-fhl-176033.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to qualify as a furnished holiday let<\/a> (FHL), but it does come with its benefits. For example, it can provide much higher rental yields, as you can charge considerably more across one week than a residential buy-to-let. You do need to account for off-peak seasons though \u2013 so if you\u2019d like more consistency, renting out your home to a tenant long-term may be the better option.  <\/p>\n<p>There are tax advantages for owning a holiday-let, though. Because it\u2019s seen as a business rather than an investment, this means the income you generate is classed as \u2018relevant earnings\u2019 so you\u2019ll be able to make pension contributions and reduce your tax bill. However, it is worth noting that to qualify for these benefits you must successfully let out 105 days out of the 210 you need to have available. <\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to change my insurance and mortgage as an accidental landlord?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes! You\u2019re likely to have standard insurance already if you lived in the home previously, but this won\u2019t cover you once you become a landlord. You will need to inform your insurer of any new changes and have your policy updated to landlord insurance (this is great to have as it offers more protection, such as liability cover). You\u2019ll need to ensure you do the same with your mortgage too, to make sure your lender is happy for the property to be rented out. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for accidental landlords.
