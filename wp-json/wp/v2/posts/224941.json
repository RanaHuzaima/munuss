But things like ordering snacks for the office, eating the snacks, and stroking the dogs all vary each day. <\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter? <\/h3>\n<p>A challenge I regularly encounter within my role is ensuring that the clients are the centre of everything we do. I always want to ensure that the client is happy with their service and help them find the answer for their queries as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Although, I\u2019m sure everyone at TAP will agree that my biggest challenge so far has been organising a coach for one of our staff nights out. Let&#8217;s just say it was a very wobbly experience, but we got there, eventually!<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients? <\/h3>\n<p>HMRCs hold time. This is why we are so keen to receive clients&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/where-can-i-find-my-unique-taxpayer-reference-utr-number-1403.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UTR numbers<\/a> and codes as soon as they receive them, so they aren\u2019t falling asleep listening to HMRC&#8217;s hold music whilst they\u2019ve got businesses to run.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job? <\/h3>\n<p>Definitely the people! But I also really love opening the post and organising the cupboards. I\u2019m quite simple really.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership? <\/h3>\n<p>I love how everyone bands together when someone is struggling. I\u2019ve never worked in a place before where you are genuinely looked after. <\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job? <\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m very creative which gives me a great innovative approach. Thinking outside the box helps me to stay organised and keep on top of my workload as much as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>Where&#8217;s your favourite place to visit on days off? <\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t venture out much on my days off, you can usually find me doing some new wild art hobby. I\u2019ve taken a huge interest in nail art at the moment, so I\u2019m sure my days off will be taken up with that soon.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us your proudest achievement <\/h3>\n<p>My proudest achievement has been my university experience. I have gained a Fine Art degree, a teaching qualification and Art Practice Masters. I also received a Student of the Year award whilst completing my teaching qualification, although I have no idea how.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you? <\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve been dreading this question because I get told on a daily basis how weird I am. The comments I get from the Admin girls often are that I\u2019m the \u2018Rebel of the Office\u2019, Feeder\/Willy Wonka because I\u2019m always handing out chocolate, and incredibly unfiltered. But I\u2019m sure they all love me really.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment? <\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve just finished reading Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, and it\u2019s Spooky Season so I\u2019m watching everything Tim Burton!<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why? <\/h3>\n<p>I really admire my Mum and how she has the biggest passion for care work that I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m pretty sure she loves her residents more than me, it\u2019s actually quite sweet. I can\u2019t comment on whether or not she did a good job raising me as a single mum because I\u2019ve turned out really odd haha.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what&#8217;s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Do you think it is acceptable to say whatever comes to mind IMMEDIATELY? (Asking for a friend&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely, without a shred of doubt.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
