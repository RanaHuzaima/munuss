Either way, to ensure you\u2019re paid (correctly <em>and<\/em> on time) you might need to send out an invoice.<\/p>\n<p>Sending invoices may seem scary at first, but it\u2019s vital for both you and your clients to have a record of what\u2019s what. It also means you can show these figures in your bookkeeping \u2013 which is <em>vital<\/em> for completing tax returns accurately, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming things like business expenses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In some instances, sending an invoice is a legal requirement \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-do-i-register-for-vat-our-guide-to-vat-registration-93406.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you and your client are both VAT-registered<\/a>. We\u2019ll discuss what an invoice is, and how you can create one. <\/p>\n<h3>What is an invoice?<\/h3>\n<p>An invoice is essentially a document to request payment for work or goods sold. They normally include an itemised list of what was supplied, the cost of each unit, handling fees or shipping costs, any VAT that&#8217;s added, and the total amount to pay. <\/p>\n<p>Accurate invoicing is an essential part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">record keeping process for your business<\/a>. It also means you have more chance of being paid promptly and for the right amount \u2013 over or undercharging a customer or client can cause a lot of confusion, and even delay payment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\"><strong>Top tip:<\/strong> Keep copies of your invoices to show how much you earned and any taxes you collected on the sale.<\/div>\n<h3>Who needs to send an invoice?<\/h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>If you\u2019re selling products or services to a customer who\u2019s <em>not<\/em> VAT-registered then a receipt should suffice unless they ask you for an invoice.<\/li>\n<li>If it\u2019s a business-to-business transaction where you\u2019re both VAT-registered, by law you <em>must<\/em> send them an invoice.<\/li>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 650px;\" title=\"Filing Requirements\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Who-needs-to-send-an-invoice_-Final-Draft.svg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Is a receipt the same as an invoice?<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to get confused between a receipt and an invoice. A receipt is an acknowledgment that payment has been received, whereas an invoice shows what goods or services a payment is expected for (and when!).<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s included in an invoice?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important you don\u2019t miss anything out on your invoices. They must include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>An identification number that is unique<\/li>\n<li>Your business name, address, and any contact information<\/li>\n<li>Your customer or client\u2019s name and address<\/li>\n<li>A clear description of exactly what you\u2019re charging for<\/li>\n<li>The supply date (the date on which goods or services were provided)<\/li>\n<li>The date of the invoice<\/li>\n<li>The amounts charged<\/li>\n<li>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/the-vat-jargon-buster-for-businesses-7764.html#vat-number\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VAT number<\/a> and the amount of VAT which was charged (if you\u2019re VAT-registered)<\/li>\n<li>The total amount<\/li>\n<li>What <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-the-best-way-to-take-invoice-payments-from-clients-13511.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payment methods you accept<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re a sole trader, you also need to include your name and any business name being used, as well as an address where any legal documents can be delivered. Limited companies must include the full company name and registration number as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/how-to-register-as-a-limited-company-in-the-uk-60721.html#what-happens-after-i-register-a-limited-company\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shown on their certificate of incorporation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Once you know exactly what needs to be on your invoices, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how you want it to look. It doesn\u2019t need to be black and white; you can personalise it to match your business. This includes adding your brand colours, logo and even a thank you message at the bottom. <\/p>\n<h3>Are my invoices different If I\u2019m VAT registered?<\/h3>\n<p>Being VAT-registered comes with more requirements in general, so there are some differences in what you must show on your invoices. You\u2019ll need to send &#8216;VAT invoices\u2019, which include a breakdown of the of VAT charged, what items it was charged on, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-rates-and-thresholds\/how-much-is-vat-in-the-uk-200582.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the VAT rate used<\/a>, and whether there are any zero rate or exempt items (as well as the reason). <\/p>\n<h3>How do I create an invoice?<\/h3>\n<p>The good news is that you <em>don\u2019t<\/em> need to create an invoice from scratch on a Word document each time you get a new client or customer. <\/p>\n<p>You can use online templates (there are plenty on the likes of Canva) or even use bookkeeping software to create your invoices and automatically record them in your bookkeeping straight away (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/free-bookkeeping-software\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">like our very own Pandle does<\/a>!). <\/p>\n<p>If you choose not to use software, it\u2019s still important to ensure you keep a record of this information in your bookkeeping. This will make your life <em>much<\/em> easier when it comes to checking who has paid, and who still needs to (and it\u2019ll allow you to give HMRC everything they need).<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How long should I wait for a client to pay the invoice I\u2019ve sent to them?<\/h3>\n<p>You should always include the invoice date and its due date. The usual rule of thumb is 30 days from the invoice date \u2013 but every client is different, and some may have a shorter, or longer arrangement with you. <\/p>\n<p>A lot of businesses and customers will pay the invoice within 24-48 hours, although some may take a little longer. If you use bookkeeping software, you can send <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandle.com\/features\/invoicing\/#payment-reminders\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">automatic payment reminders<\/a>, which should prompt the majority of your clients to pay if they\u2019ve forgotten (which is the main reason many people don\u2019t pay on time). <\/p>\n<h3>What do I do if my client doesn\u2019t pay their invoice?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/dealing-with-late-payments-in-a-business-7493.html#my-customers-payment-is-late-whats-the-first-step-i-should-take\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Late payments can really cause a strain<\/a> in a business, and can be stressful to deal with. If you\u2019ve sent email reminders, letters and tried to call the client you may consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Charge interest on any late payments<\/li>\n<li>Cancel future work you have with the client, or pause anything you\u2019re in the middle of<\/li>\n<li>Take legal advice for late payments (you\u2019ll likely be advised on what to do next based on how much is owed to you. For example, you may find it\u2019s better to simply write it off if the amount is too small to be deemed worth the hassle, or you may be told to submit a Small Claims Court N1 form for larger debts).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
