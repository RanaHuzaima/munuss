It\u2019s continued to grow in popularity, making it the perfect role for those who are looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-on-my-hobby-side-business-13671.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earn some extra cash through a side hustle<\/a> or want something flexible that suits them. <\/p>\n<p>It does come with its complexities though, because while Uber drivers are now classed as \u2018workers\u2019 (so you&#8217;re entitled to things like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/whats-the-difference-between-the-national-living-wage-and-the-national-minimum-wage-90465.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> National Living Wage<\/a>, holiday pay, and a pension), you are <em>not<\/em> an employee. <\/p>\n<p>So, despite the new worker laws, for tax purposes you\u2019re self-employed, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-type-of-tax-return-do-i-need-to-submit-2566.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that means submitting a tax return<\/a>.

For example, if you\u2019re earning over a certain threshold and want to be more tax efficient by taking a smaller salary and paying yourself the rest in dividends.  <\/p>\n<p>A limited company comes with more responsibility, and you\u2019ll need to submit a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Company Tax Return<\/a> (<em>and<\/em> pay Corporation Tax) as well as a Self Assessment tax return.

Most of your costs are likely to qualify as a business expense, as long as you can prove that they\u2019re genuine.

It normally means an employee is guaranteed work and, because they know their hours, they know <em>exactly<\/em> how much they\u2019ll be taking home each month. <\/p>\n<p>A worker, on the other hand, has more flexibility, with the autonomy to choose when they work but this can also mean there isn\u2019t always as much work available.
