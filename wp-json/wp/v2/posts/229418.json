There are plenty of platforms to choose from, like Facebook, Instagram, and more recently, TikTok. <\/p>\n<p>TikTok has transformed the way customers shop, giving them an up-close preview of what they can purchase, as well as a seamless way to pay without needing to leave the app. It boasts 50 million <em>daily<\/em> users, so it\u2019s no surprise it\u2019s turned many small businesses into overnight successes.  <\/p>\n<p>It can take a lot of hard work to get things going though, and you may need to collaborate with influencers or go on TikTok live to sell your products. If you\u2019re selling services rather than products, it may involve putting yourself out there to a large audience. It\u2019s worth weighing up the pros and cons before you decide to give it a go.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s run through the ins and outs of selling on TikTok and whether it\u2019s time to put it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/marketing\/creating-a-marketing-plan-for-your-small-business-55696.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in your marketing plan<\/a>.   <\/p>\n<h3>What is TikTok Shop?<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok Shop is essentially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/paying-tax-when-you-sell-through-online-marketplaces-78286.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an e-commerce platform<\/a> integrated within TikTok. If you have your own business, it allows you to showcase your products and designs to a community of people. <\/p>\n<h4>Who can use TikTok Shop?<\/h4>\n<p>Anyone over the age of 18 who lives in the UK and has the TikTok app! <\/p>\n<h3>How does TikTok Shop work?<\/h3>\n<p>There are 3 different formats you can use on TikTok Shop.<\/p>\n<h4>Live shopping<\/h4>\n<p>This is where you or one of your employees host a livestream showcasing the products you have on offer. Anyone can join this live and interact with you in real-time. For example, if you\u2019re selling loungewear, they may ask to see it in a bigger size, or a different colour. <\/p>\n<p>If a customer wants to purchase an item, they can simply add it to their basket, and pay without leaving the app. It can be a useful selling tactic, allowing you to answer customers&#8217; queries much quicker, which can often result in them purchasing the product right away.<\/p>\n<h4>Short videos<\/h4>\n<p>Create a short video of your product and include a link for your audience to purchase it.<\/p>\n<h4>Product showcase tab<\/h4>\n<p>Your product showcase is located in the tab of either your seller or creator profile. It\u2019s basically a list of products users can browse through and shop.<\/p>\n<h3>What type of TikTok advertisements can I choose from?<\/h3>\n<p>At a glance TikTok may look like it\u2019s just for businesses advertising physical products, but you can use it for practically anything. For example, if you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/recruitment-agencies\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">own a recruitment business<\/a> and want sign-ups to a vacancy newsletter, or you\u2019re selling tickets for an online webinar you\u2019re hosting.  <\/p>\n<p>Methods of advertising you can use on TikTok include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>In-feed ads:<\/strong> These are videos that blend in with a user&#8217;s usual content. As the name suggests, it\u2019ll be in their feed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Branded hashtags:<\/strong> This is where you create filters and effects users can try in their own videos, helping to create awareness around your brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>TopView:<\/strong> This essentially means they\u2019re the first in-feed ad to appear when someone is scrolling TikTok. It will hold position for a set period of time before it turns into a regular in-feed ad. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Brand takeover:<\/strong> You\u2019ll \u2018take over\u2019 the initial TikTok loading screen by displaying branded content that leads users to a landing page of your choice.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Collection:<\/strong> You can create a \u2018collection\u2019 or gallery ad that will allow users to browse and purchase products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Costs vary across all methods, but if none of these are for you, you can also think about things like TikTok live, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-influencers-pay-tax-243980.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hiring influencers<\/a> to promote your content. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/amazon-ecommerce-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Ecommerce accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Accounting for eCommerce sellers from \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How do I know if TikTok is the right sales channel for me?<\/h3>\n<p>It depends on a few things, starting with whether your target market is on TikTok.  If you find it predominately <em>isn\u2019t<\/em>, you\u2019ll waste time and money posting advertisements to the wrong people. <\/p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is time. Can you make eye-catching adverts? Would you be happy working with influencers? You\u2019ll find many successful businesses on TikTok spend lots of time promoting their products, whether that be through short videos, or collaborating with creators. <\/p>\n<p>You can always hire freelancers to make content for you, but you\u2019ll need to consider the cost of both paying them and paying for an ad to go up (as well as TikTok\u2019s other fees). It\u2019s also worth noting TikTok charges 5% commission on everything you sell on TikTok Shop. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s best to ensure you know your target market and run A\/B tests to see if TikTok works better for you than your usual advertising methods.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">If you\u2019re paying for any kind of marketing or advertising, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html#what-business-expenses-are-allowable\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check if you can claim it as an allowable expense<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>Do I need to set up a business account with TikTok?<\/h3>\n<p>If your goal is to promote your services or products on TikTok, you\u2019ll need to set up a business account.

In order to stand out, you need to find a niche and know your audience. The largest age groups on TikTok are teens, 20\u201329-year-olds, and 30-39-year-olds. <\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t reach an older audience but if you are looking for people in a particular demographic, it\u2019s worth asking yourself <em>how<\/em> you can do that. Are there specific trends your audience tends to participate in, for instance?<\/p>\n<h4>Research<\/h4>\n<p>This ties in nicely with what we\u2019ve said above \u2013 to attract the right audience, you\u2019ll need to do regular research on what\u2019s trending within the demographic you\u2019re targeting, and how you can relate that to your brand. <\/p>\n<h4>Collaborate<\/h4>\n<p>Finding a content creator who is your \u2018ideal customer\u2019 could benefit your brand \u2013 because the likelihood is, their followers are also going to fit in that category too. <\/p>\n<p>There are some things to consider when you open your business up on TikTok. For example, some businesses face bad reviews in the form of videos (which can damage a business&#8217;s reputation), although this is rare and tends to happen to larger businesses. It\u2019s also competitive \u2013 there are lots of businesses offering discounts to customers and you may not be able to compete, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-start-a-business-from-scratch-74629.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">especially if you\u2019re just starting out<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s best to think about the type of advertisements that would work for you and test the waters.
