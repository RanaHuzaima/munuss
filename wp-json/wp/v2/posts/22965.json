In this article we explain how National Insurance works for self-employed people, how much you need to pay, and when.<\/p>\n<h3>What is National Insurance (NI)?<\/h3>\n<p>National Insurance is a type of tax paid by employees, employers, and self-employed people. Also known as NI contributions (or NICs for short) these payments go towards your eligibility for the state pension and some types of benefits. To make sure National Insurance Contributions are recorded correctly, each person has their own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/national-insurance\/what-is-national-insurance-3855.html#do-i-need-a-national-insurance-number\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unique NI number<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll normally start making National Insurance contributions on &#8216;qualifying income&#8217; once your earnings pass the NI threshold, from the age of 16 up until state retirement age (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/national-insurance\/do-you-pay-national-insurance-on-pension-income-619.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you won&#8217;t pay National Insurance on your pension<\/a> or earnings after retirement). Some people decide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/can-i-become-self-employed-after-i-retire-3698.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">start their own business after retirement<\/a>, but you won&#8217;t be expected to make contributions on your self-employed income if you&#8217;re older than state pension age.<\/p>\n<h3>How much is self-employed National Insurance?<\/h3>\n<p>Self-employed people pay National Insurance on their profits, so the amount of NI you pay depends on how much profit you make in a year.<\/p>\n<p>There are currently two different types of self-employed National Insurance (known as classes), although one of these will be abolished from April 2024 onwards:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Class 2:<\/strong> Class 2 National Insurance is paid as a flat rate once profits reach the \u00a312,570 Lower Profits Threshold (LPT), although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-news\/budget-updates\/what-does-the-autumn-statement-2023-mean-for-my-business-227961.html#national-insurance-self-employed-people\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Class 2 NI will be abolished from April 2024<\/a> onwards. <strong>You will still need to pay Class 2 NI on profits for the 2023\/24 tax year (6th April 2023 &#8211; 5th April 2024)<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Class 4:<\/strong> Class 4 NI is paid as a percentage of any profits you earn above the \u00a312,570 Lower Profits Limit (LPL)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"50%\"><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Annual Threshold<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size:0.8rem\">2023\/24<\/b><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-greyheader\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Annual Threshold<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size:0.8rem\">2024\/25<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">No National Insurance to pay on profits in this range, but you can make voluntary payments to fill any gaps in your NI record.<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Below \u00a36,725<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Below \u00a36,725<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"> <strong>Small Profits Threshold (SPT):<\/strong> You won\u2019t pay NI on profits at or above this and below the Lower Profits Threshold (LPT), but you will accrue National Insurance credits.<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a36,725<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00a36,725<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Lower Profits Threshold (LPT):<\/strong> Start paying Class 2 National Insurance once profits reach this threshold.<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>2023\/24:<\/strong> \u00a33.45 per week<\/dd>\n<dd><strong>2024\/25:<\/strong> Abolished<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a312,570<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00a312,570<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Lower Profits Limit (LPL):<\/strong> Pay Class 4 National Insurance on profits above this threshold at a rate of:<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>2023\/24:<\/strong> 9%<\/dd>\n<dd><strong>2024\/25:<\/strong> 6%<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a312,570<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00a312,570<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Upper Profits Limit (UPL):<\/strong> Pay Class 4 NI at a slightly different rate on profits above this threshold.<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dd><strong>2023\/24:<\/strong> 2%<\/dd>\n<dd><strong>2024\/25:<\/strong> 2%<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a350,270<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00a350,270<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>How do I pay National Insurance (NI)?<\/h3>\n<p>Self-employed people pay National Insurance when they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit their Self Assessment tax return<\/a> to report the profits and other income they receive in a tax year. <\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be given a tax calculation once you submit your return, and this will show the breakdown of different taxes that you owe.
