It\u2019s vital to keep on top of this so planning ahead and keeping organised is essential.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients? <\/h3>\n<p>What I\u2019ve noticed is that for clients it\u2019s more about what they don\u2019t know, than what they do know, on a day-to-day basis. Some things can catch them by surprise or can cause a lot of anxiety and frustration, and it\u2019s our job to guide people and provide the knowledge and services they need to ease their concerns, answer their queries in a timely manner, and help everyone stay HMRC compliant.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them? <\/h3>\n<p>Coming from a technical background in MI analysis and technical support before becoming an accountant has prepared me for a number of the challenges we face here as well as my AAT studies. Being methodical, organised, friendly and approachable, as well as being able to remain calm under pressure, are skills I have honed over the years. <\/p>\n<p>I was once told by one of the higher-ups in a previous life that even if the building was literally on fire, &#8220;no one would panic with you in the room&#8221;, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s stuck with me all these years. \ud83d\ude0a<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job? <\/h3>\n<p>Working with a variety of clients from all kinds of professions and trades is incredible, and really opens me up to a lot of different challenges which I enjoy. Also, the other accountants I work with, it\u2019s a great place to work. <\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership? <\/h3>\n<p>Their ideologies and the people. It\u2019s a rapidly growing company that still has that family feel to it and everyone is so friendly and welcoming, plus the benefits and training here are fantastic.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job? <\/h3>\n<p>Communication, communication, communication! Keeping everyone updated on where you\u2019re at and providing clarity and closure is vital to be successful, plus the knowledge I have gained and continue to gain is key. <\/p>\n<h3>Where&#8217;s your favourite place to visit on days off? <\/h3>\n<p>If I\u2019m not at the gym, watching the rugby or at the pub, I\u2019m out and about with my fianc\u00e9e shopping, visiting family or going out to dinner. <\/p>\n<h3>Tell us your proudest achievement <\/h3>\n<p>Taking the leap to become an accountant.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you? <\/h3>\n<p>I would like to think that they consider me as a friendly and easy-going guy that\u2019s always happy to help. I also think they may see me as the guy who thinks the gym is the answer to everything, with a bit of a caffeine addiction. I love coffee, ok?! \ud83d\ude0a  <\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment? <\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve never been much of a reader, (although I would like to be) but I do love watching all sorts of genres with my other half, such as horror, thriller, comedies etc. My guilty pleasure is anime, I\u2019m currently binging Jujutsu Kaisen at the moment.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why? <\/h3>\n<p>It would honestly be my fianc\u00e9e Tiffany (Tiff), she\u2019s one of the most resilient people I\u2019ve ever met with a heart of gold and completely changed me, bring on our wedding day! <\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what&#8217;s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Which is better, Rugby League or Rugby Union? <\/p>\n<p>Union, obvs!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
