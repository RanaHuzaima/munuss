Known as \u2018holding\u2019 companies, they\u2019re not just for massive international organisations. <\/p>\n<p>Businesses of any size can set up a holding company, and will do so for lots of different reasons. We look at what they are, how they work, and how holding companies are created.  <\/p>\n<h3>What is a holding company?<\/h3>\n<p>In most cases, a holding company won\u2019t manufacture products, sell goods, or provide services in its own right. Rather than trading, they\u2019re often created to \u2018hold\u2019 (i.e. own) assets such as equipment, machinery, property, or even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/protecting-your-business-name-intellectual-property-and-trademarks-53379.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trademarks and copyrights<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>You might also see holding companies referred to as a \u2018parent\u2019 company if they own 50% or more of another business &#8211; known as a subsidiary company. <\/p>\n<h4>What are subsidiaries?<\/h4>\n<p>A subsidiary company is a business owned and controlled by another company. For a holding company to qualify a company as a subsidiary according to the Companies Act 2006, it needs to:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Be a member of the said subsidiary<\/li>\n<li>Own more than 50% of the voting rights<\/li>\n<li>Have a right to both appoint and remove most the company\u2019s board of directors<\/li>\n<li>Solely control a majority of the voting rights (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/shareholders\/what-is-a-shareholder-of-a-company-3837.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as agreed with other shareholders<\/a>) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/limited-company-formations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company registration service<\/h3>\n<p>We will incorporate your company free of charge!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Should I set up a holding company?<\/h3>\n<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to every business decision, depending on your circumstances. We\u2019ll take a look at some of the main considerations and uses, so you can decide whether creating a holding company is for you. <\/p>\n<h4>Buying, selling, or creating other companies <\/h4>\n<p>Some businesses create subsidiaries to explore or launch into a new market. This could be branching out in a different country or starting a business in a completely different industry. Setting up a subsidiary allows you to experiment and trial new things, without harming the businesses you already have. <\/p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/buying-an-existing-business-14757.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buy or takeover an existing company<\/a> which already has its own brand, owning it through a holding company allows it to keep its established reputation while your business helps control it from behind the scenes. This could be a great business investment, as the companies won\u2019t be merged or associated with one another, so it\u2019s business as usual.  <\/p>\n<h4>Separating assets from the business<\/h4>\n<p>You can also use a holding company to separate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-are-business-assets-86076.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">business assets such as property or equipment<\/a> from your subsidiary companies.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>For example<\/h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you own a company that offers legal services, and the business owns the office building you&#8217;re based in.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re ready to sell your business, but don\u2019t want to part with the building just yet because property prices are lower than normal. <\/p>\n<p>Transferring the property to a holding company means you can sell the business whilst keeping hold of the property until the market perks up.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<h4>Potential tax benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Moving cash and assets from one business to another normally results in a tax bill, but creating a holding company can allow you to move things between entities without incurring tax. As ever though, tax rules are very complicated \u2013 always take advice!<\/p>\n<h4>Minimised risks<\/h4>\n<p>A holding company is a separate legal entity to the businesses it owns, so keeping your businesses separate can be a way to protect company assets. For example, if one company goes bankrupt, your other companies won\u2019t be affected. You also won\u2019t lose your valuable assets if they\u2019re owned by the holding company!<\/p>\n<p>It can be great for experimenting too. If you wanted to try out a new product, or test out a new market that\u2019s high risk, you could create a subsidiary \u2013 meaning if it doesn\u2019t work out, any losses are not transferred to the holding company, and in turn don\u2019t affect any subsidiaries you have that are doing well.<\/p>\n<h4>Financial transparency<\/h4>\n<p>Setting up multiple operations can make it more difficult to see your overall financial health. It can also make it trickier to explain your finances to potential lenders or investors! <\/p>\n<h3>How do I register a holding company?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that a holding company isn\u2019t a type of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/which-legal-structure-should-i-choose-when-i-start-a-business-14385.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">legal business structure in the UK<\/a>, although most holding companies are limited companies, and setting one up is no different to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/how-to-register-as-a-limited-company-in-the-uk-60721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">creating any other company limited by shares<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Step-by-step guide to registering a holding company<\/h4>\n<div class=\"blog-step\">\n<h4>1. Pick a unique business name and register with Companies House.<\/h4>\n<p>This is really easy to do and can be done online or by post. You might even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/what-is-the-difference-between-a-company-name-and-a-trading-name-162426.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">choose a company name and then use a separate trading name<\/a>.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blog-step\">\n<h4>2. Appoint company directors<\/h4>\n<p>This is an important step <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/directors\/what-responsibilities-do-directors-have-in-a-limited-company-13504.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as the directors of your holding company are responsible for making key decisions<\/a> and overseeing the day-to-day management.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blog-step\">\n<h4>3. Write a business plan<\/h4>\n<p>Every business needs to have a plan, but it can be particularly complex when you have multiple subsidiaries. So, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-write-the-perfect-business-plan-25798.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">creating a business plan<\/a> is vital!\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blog-step\">\n<h4>4. File a memorandum and articles of association to Companies House<\/h4>\n<p>This is a bit like having a set of rules for your holding company to follow, and an explanation of its structure (don\u2019t let the name scare you too much, it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds). The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-model-articles-of-association-in-a-limited-company-196848.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">articles of association<\/a> must be signed by all of the shareholders.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"final-blog-step\">\n<h4>5. Open a business bank account<\/h4>\n<p>Once you\u2019re good to go, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bank-accounts\/do-i-need-a-business-bank-account-7561.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opening a business bank account<\/a> is crucial to begin receiving and sending any financial transactions.<br \/>\n&nbsp;\n<\/div>\n<h3>Can I set up a holding company for my current business? <\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can create a holding company that has full ownership of an existing business. If your holding company owns 100%, your current business is known as a \u2018wholly owned subsidiary\u2019. <\/p>\n<h3>Can anyone own a holding company?<\/h3>\n<p>Anyone can create a holding company \u2013 but you\u2019ll need to make sure it fulfils all the legal requirements to qualify as one. It can be hard to understand, so we\u2019d recommend chatting with an accountant to ensure it\u2019s the right move for you. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Need to speak to an accountant about creating a holding company?
