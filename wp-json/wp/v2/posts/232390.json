Part of that means we need to recruit people from other teams to be in our reels, which they hate (but also secretly love tbh) and then film, edit and schedule, etc. A typical day can also consist of people wondering what on earth Marketing are actually up to\u2026we like to keep them all guessing!<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Not having any accounting knowledge is a challenge when it comes to creating content for social posts, but we have our lovely accountants who help us when we have any questions or if we\u2019re unsure about information we\u2019ve researched.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job? <\/h3>\n<p>I love the variation of my role; no two days are the same (which is probably something you\u2019ll hear most Marketers say). I also love the constant learning process that comes with being in Marketing, it\u2019s always changing and its fun learning new things. <\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership? <\/h3>\n<p>The main thing is definitely the atmosphere. It\u2019s relaxed and informal but still has that air of professionalism. We have a laugh, but we also work hard and the balance is great. Everyone is so nice and approachable which helps, especially when you\u2019re a newbie. Also\u2026 DOGS IN THE OFFICE!!!! I bring my dog in too which is amazing.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job? <\/h3>\n<p>My organisation skills help me a lot. In a role that is so varied, it\u2019s crucial to be able to sort multiple tasks at once, but I love it &#8211; it keeps me on my toes!<\/p>\n<h3>Where&#8217;s your favourite place to visit on days off? <\/h3>\n<p>Spending time with my family and going on walks with our doggo. We regularly visit the Lake District; we\u2019ve been going for years and we love it.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you? <\/h3>\n<p>Hopefully they would describe me as helpful, friendly and a little bit weird (because being weird is fun and chaotic! :D)<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment? <\/h3>\n<p>I haven\u2019t read much recently but in terms of binge watching, I\u2019m watching &#8216;Fool Me Once&#8217; on Netflix at the moment and some classic comfort shows I go back to are &#8216;Dead to Me&#8217; and &#8216;ER&#8217; (The US Drama Series)<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why? <\/h3>\n<p>Honestly just everyone in my life right now. That\u2019s all, that\u2019s the answer. I could never pick just one person.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what&#8217;s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Dogs? Yes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
