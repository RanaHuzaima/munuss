Following these simple tips may help you get everything in order. <\/p>\n<h4>Gather paperwork<\/h4>\n<p>Every report and tax return you produce should be based on the cold hard facts of your company&#8217;s records, such as bank statements, receipts, invoices, payroll&#8230; and so on. It\u2019s yet another reason why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">good bookkeeping habits are essential for every business<\/a>! <\/p>\n<h4>Chase overdue payments<\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019ll want your accounts to be accurate as possible, and the last thing you need is to pay taxes on money you don\u2019t actually have yet. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/dealing-with-late-payments-in-a-business-7493.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Crack down on any late payments <\/a> before your reporting deadline to ensure you get the money in on time.  <\/p>\n<h4>Sort your expenses out<\/h4>\n<p>Remember, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/limited-company-expenses-guide-can-claim-6140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you\u2019re entitled to expenses<\/a>! Claiming expenses will reduce your profits, which means you pay less Corporation Tax. Keep track of everything your company spends, and ensure you claim for anything you\u2019ve used \u2018wholly and exclusively\u2019 for your business. <\/p>\n<h4>Cross-check everything<\/h4>\n<p>Ensure everything adds up. You don\u2019t want your accounts to say one thing, and your supporting documents to say another. If you\u2019re unable to get payments for some invoices, list them as outstanding debts owed rather than revenue and include any notes you think are necessary \u2013 for example, if you think you might not be paid by a customer, or if there\u2019s currently a dispute. <\/p>\n<h4>Consider hiring an accountant<\/h4>\n<p>The easiest way to ensure things run smoothly is to hire an accountant. They can get to know your business and put your mind at ease if you have any burning questions or anxieties. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/preparing-your-business-for-a-new-year-43783.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about preparing your business for a new year<\/a><\/div>\n<h3>Is there anything else my limited company needs to think about?<\/h3>\n<p>There are other things to consider (<em>some<\/em> mandatory), they include:<\/p>\n<h4>VAT returns<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re VAT-registered and on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/the-different-types-of-vat-schemes-119533.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flat Rate or Standard scheme<\/a>, you may have a VAT return due around the time of your company year-end. Always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/how-do-i-submit-a-vat-return-14690.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ensure your VAT returns are sent off on time<\/a> and pay HMRC if needed. <\/p>\n<h4>Confirmation Statement <\/h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-is-a-confirmation-statement-91784.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Confirmation Statement<\/a> allows the director of a limited company to confirm their information with Companies House is up to date. You need to file this within 14 days of its due date (which is normally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/how-to-register-as-a-limited-company-in-the-uk-60721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a year after your incorporation date<\/a>, although you\u2019ll need to submit one sooner if you need to report any major changes). <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">You need to submit a Confirmation Statement, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dormant-company\/dormant-companies-explained-8202.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">even if your company is dormant<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>Review how your company operates<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s a great idea to check your suppliers annually. For example, has the price gone up in the last year? Is the quality of service the same? Could you be getting a better deal elsewhere?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth looking at your finances to see if there is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/how-do-i-reduce-my-tax-bill-14261.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">anything you can do to be more tax efficient<\/a>. For instance, by paying money into an ISA or putting more money into your pension. The good news is an accountant can help you with all of this and ensure you\u2019re saving as much money as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Need to speak to an accountant?
