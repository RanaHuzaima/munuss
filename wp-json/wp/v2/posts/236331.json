This is done through distributing news from within the company to local, national or trade press and working with journalists to secure placements for press releases or comments in breaking news stories. <\/p>\n<p>The external comms is effectively a media-friendly version of TAP\u2019s business objectives and I create and push key messages that align with the company\u2019s brand. <\/p>\n<p>Sometimes I work on events, like promotional events for the company, to make our public relations activity more newsworthy. I also work with content and social media teams on topical issues relating to tax and accounting to align the three disciplines and ensure TAP\u2019s brand messaging is direct. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, I conduct market research to understand our customers and trends to create PR campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>First is to read the news and provide a media briefing to my colleagues, who often choose a story to engage our followers on our social media channels. <\/p>\n<p>Then I will identify any news opportunities that day for us to react to, send a comment to our news contacts or respond to any media enquiries. Most of my day is spent devising news from business objectives and thinking laterally about the news agenda to see how we can create news content that will be published in local, regional national and trade press. <\/p>\n<p>I work on multiple stories at once \u2013 due to waiting for third parties or colleagues to provide input \u2013 and then devise press lists to send the content too. Then I pitch the stories to the press and monitor coverage.<\/p>\n<h3>What challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s often difficult to get timely information from my colleagues because they\u2019re so busy working with clients.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges you face in your work?<\/h3>\n<p>I would say the biggest challenge for any PR is finding news that will stick and get the attention of journalists.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems? <\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re working as a journalist, you develop a news sense. It\u2019s a strange thing: you begin to automatically turn information into headlines and feel a story. Not everyone has it and I\u2019ve worked with some PR\u2019s who have no journalism experience but get on by being good sales people. I\u2019ve been working in PR, journalism, events and social media for 13 years now so it\u2019s almost become second nature to me and this means I can work quickly and implement PR campaigns that will be successful.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job? <\/h3>\n<p>I love a good story, so seeing a press release I\u2019ve written and TAP&#8217;s name on websites like Mail Online is what it\u2019s all about for me.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership? <\/h3>\n<p>My colleagues are lovely people and contrary to every other news room I\u2019ve worked in, it\u2019s very relaxed here which is great. <\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job? <\/h3>\n<p>Good communication skills.<\/p>\n<h3>Where&#8217;s your favourite place to visit on days off? <\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m an avid swimmer so I love going to the pool when I\u2019m off work. <\/p>\n<h3>Tell us your proudest achievement? <\/h3>\n<p>My self-employed PR contracts came to an end in 2022 and I started working at a SEND school while I looked for a full-time role. The teachers were amazed I had no teaching experience and asked me to stay for the entire year after two weeks working there. <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m very proud that I was able to make a difference in the lives of the kids who go there and their families. It was a moving experience and I saw life from a completely different perspective. The kids taught me more about life than most people I\u2019ve met.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you? <\/h3>\n<p>The Snack King.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment? <\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m not reading or watching anything because I spend all my spare time making lo-fi music if I\u2019m not swimming.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire and why? <\/h3>\n<p>My friend Fast from a band called Fun Lovin\u2019 Criminals. They have been my favourite band since I was 12 and I\u2019ve worked with them on press and events since 2016, so we have become good friends. <\/p>\n<p>In fact, as I\u2019m writing this, their seminal debut album Come Find Yourself is celebrating its 28th birthday and I\u2019ve arranged an interview for Fast with The Guardian. He\u2019s a genuine person, plays seven instruments and is currently playing sold out shows in Australia on tour. We\u2019ve had loads of good times and work together well, too. <\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what&#8217;s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>What\u2019s the difference between a crocodile and an alligator? One will see you in a while, the other will see you later.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
