These include Sole Trader and Limited Company Accounts, tax returns for individuals and companies, VAT Returns, and Pandle Software Support.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>I normally start my day creating a to-do list for what needs to be done that day. I will then check my emails to see if there are any emails that require responding to, whether it be because they are from the prior day, or because it is an urgent email that requires immediate attention. I then start making my way through my to-do list, which usually consists of work on accounts and tax returns, or it may include an abundance of VAT Returns if the VAT deadline is approaching.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, a client may ask a question that has me stumped, so, to get around this, I will ask other members of the team for help. That is one of the benefits of working at TAP, everyone is so lovely and happy to help.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients? <\/h3>\n<p>A lot of my clients are new to operating a business, so they often require additional guidance with their bookkeeping and understanding, e.g., deadlines and what expenses can and cannot be claimed for.<\/p>\n<p>I am always happy to help and support my clients as much as possible. I endeavour to respond to client emails within our 24-hour turnaround time for emails, providing as much useful information as I can in my responses by giving explanations as well as useful links, whether it be to HMRC guidance or to one of our own resource pages. <\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job? <\/h3>\n<p>I quite enjoy completing a set of accounts and corresponding tax return. There is a sense of achievement that comes with each completed job. Additionally, I really enjoy helping my clients. I have so many lovely clients who often express their gratitude and appreciation for my help. It always lifts my mood and encourages me to keep working hard so that I can help even more people.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership? <\/h3>\n<p>I would have to say all the hands-on experience dealing with clients and completing accountancy work. It is busy, but so rewarding.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job? <\/h3>\n<p>I would say that time-management is a really valuable tool. In a workplace where you manage your own workload and client base, it is important to be able to manage your time effectively.<\/p>\n<h3>Where&#8217;s your favourite place to visit on days off? <\/h3>\n<p>Honestly, I am a bit of a homebody, so I love spending my days off at home cleaning\/organising, watching my favourite shows or films, and playing some videogames!<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you? <\/h3>\n<p>To quote, \u2018keen, kind, and energetic\u2019.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment? <\/h3>\n<p>I am currently rewatching Brooklyn Nine-Nine (again). It is definitely one of my favourite shows.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what&#8217;s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>What skill do you wish you had?<br \/>\nI think it would be amazing to be fluent in every single language, or to be able to play any instrument flawlessly!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
