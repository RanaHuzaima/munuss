In this article we go through some of the key changes affecting business owners.<\/p>\n<h3>Business rates: Changes to Empty Property Relief<\/h3>\n<p>Empty Property Relief means business rates don\u2019t need to be paid for the first three months a property is empty. The three-month relief period currently \u2018resets\u2019 once the property is occupied for a minimum of six weeks.<\/p>\n<p>This technically means that businesses can reduce their bill for business rates through \u201cbox shifting\u201d \u2013 moving from one property to another to take advantage of Empty Property Relief. <\/p>\n<p>Following consultation, the Spring Budget 2024 announced that the current 6-week reset period would be extended to 13 weeks. The changes come into effect in England from 1st April 2024.<\/p>\n<h3>Creative Industries tax relief: Updated rates and allowances<\/h3>\n<p>Those working in the creative industries may be able to claim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/corporation-tax-relief-for-creative-industries-companies-118001.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">specific types of tax relief aimed at supporting innovation in the sector<\/a>. We\u2019ve outlined some of the main changes below.<\/p>\n<h4>Theatre Tax Relief (TTR), Orchestra Tax Relief (OTR) and Museums and Galleries Exhibition Tax Relief (MGETR)<\/h4>\n<p>From 1st April 2025 the rate of Theatre Tax Relief (TTR), Orchestra Tax Relief (OTR) and Museums and Galleries Exhibition Tax Relief (MGETR) will be permanently set at 40% for theatres, museums, and galleries (non-touring productions), and at 45% for all orchestra and touring productions.<\/p>\n<h4>Film Studios Relief<\/h4>\n<p>Eligible film studios in England are to receive 40% relief on gross business rates. The rollout date hasn\u2019t been confirmed beyond \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 but relief will be backdated to 1st April 2024 once it\u2019s available.<\/p>\n<h4>Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit<\/h4>\n<p>There are several updates in this area, including:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The introduction of a new UK Independent Film Tax Credit set at 53% for qualifying films with a budget below \u00a315 million, where principal photography starts from 1st April 2024<\/li>\n<li>The credit rate available for the cost of visual effects in film and high-end TV will increase to 39% from April 2025<\/li>\n<li>Removal of the 80% cap for claiming visual effects costs in productions spending more than 5% of their total budget on visual effects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Expenses: Changes to claims for training costs<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">current rules for claiming expenses<\/a> only allow a business to claim tax relief on training costs if the expense relates \u201cwholly and exclusively\u201d to an existing business. It means that you can\u2019t claim expenses for training courses you take with the intention of learning skills for a new business, or to expand an existing one into a new area.<\/p>\n<p>The rules can be difficult to make sense of though. For example, a painter and decorator who goes on a course to learn bookkeeping; they need these skills to run their business but because the course doesn\u2019t directly relate to the purpose of their business, can they make a claim?<\/p>\n<p>The guidance manuals for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/are-self-employed-training-costs-a-deductible-expense-3706.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming training costs<\/a> have been updated to clear up some of the confusion, and explain that costs are claimable if you are:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Updating existing skills<\/li>\n<li>Learning new skills in order to keep up with advances in technology or changes to industry practices<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Full Expensing to include leased assets (but not yet)<\/h3>\n<p>Originally introduced as a temporary measure, Full Expensing (FE) was made permanent in the Autumn Statement 2023.
