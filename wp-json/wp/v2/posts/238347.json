Basically, anything classed as a \u2018fixed cost\u2019 <em>cannot<\/em> be claimed by a director or employee as these costs are paid regardless of whether or not the business is in operation there.  <\/p>\n<p>There are working from home expenses you incur that you <em>can<\/em> claim for though, for example calls made from your home telephone, or money towards heating and electricity bills &#8211; but there is a limit to what you can claim as well as <em>how much<\/em>.  <\/p>\n<h3>Keeping records<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to keep an accurate record of all your expenses in order to claim them unless you\u2019re claiming for flat rate expenses to help with working from home costs. <\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a limited company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ensuring you have accurate up-to-date bookkeeping<\/a> records is crucial \u2013 as well as a legal requirement!
