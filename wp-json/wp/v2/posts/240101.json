We\u2019ve adapted to a \u2018new normal\u2019 post pandemic, meaning lots of business owners work where they\u2019re most productive. Whether that be from the comfort of their own home, a coffee shop, or even on a sunny beach as they travel around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>If you dislike sand but love the outdoors, you may have thought about creating your own garden office, but can your business pay for it? This question is much more common than you may think \u2013 which we\u2019ll discuss in this blog.<\/p>\n<h3>Can my limited company pay for my garden office?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, it can, but it won\u2019t be classed as a tax-deductible expense. Instead, your garden office would be classed as <em>capital expenditure<\/em>. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term, capital expenditure refers to any long-term investment your business makes. So, think of assets such as property or furniture expected to have a \u2018useful\u2019 life of more than 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>This means that the property itself won\u2019t qualify for immediate tax relief, nor would it be classed as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an allowable expense against your business profits<\/a>. But it\u2019s not all bad \u2013 there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/tax-relief-for-the-self-employed-3833.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">other types of tax relief you may be able to claim<\/a> that\u2019ll help you run your garden office.<\/p>\n<h4>Capital allowances<\/h4>\n<p>You might not be able to claim some of the costs of installing and equipping your garden office as a running expense, but you may be able to claim tax-relief using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/the-beginners-guide-to-capital-allowances-127149.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">capital allowances<\/a>. These can help you reduce your tax bill if you buy assets for your business, such as furniture and equipment, but it <em>can\u2019t<\/em> be claimed on the building itself.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to claim for things like installing power, for example light fittings or any other electrics you have built in, or heating to keep you warm, etc.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Can I reclaim any VAT on my garden office?<\/h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/how-do-i-reclaim-vat-132750.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reclaim VAT<\/a> back when building your garden office if your company is both:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>VAT-registered<\/li>\n<li>Not using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-frs-flat-rate-scheme\/the-vat-flat-rate-scheme-frs-3753.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flat Rate VAT Scheme<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You won\u2019t be able to reclaim back the full amount of VAT if you use your garden office for personal use as well as for business purposes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">If your company pays for your garden office and it is used for personal use, it\u2019s worth noting this may be classed as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benefit in Kind.<\/a> This means you may have to complete a P11D and pay income tax (as it\u2019s a taxable benefit).<\/div>\n<h4>How do I claim for my garden office if I use the Flat Rate Scheme?<\/h4>\n<p>You can claim for capital expenditure for the goods you buy over \u00a32,000 (as long as it\u2019s on the <em>same<\/em> transaction\/receipt) \u2013 and the good thing about this is there\u2019s no limit on personal use. So, you don\u2019t have to figure out a proportion of what you can claim.<\/p>\n<p>There is a catch though \u2013 you can only claim for goods and <em>not<\/em> services. For example, you can claim back the cost of buying the shed, but not the cost of how much it was for someone to come out to construct it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019ll be the same with electrical wiring and furniture \u2013 the goods themselves can be reclaimed but any type of service cannot. Lots of suppliers can show the goods and services separately on their invoice though, so you don\u2019t have to sit and figure it out yourself &#8211; just make sure you ask when it comes to being quoted and invoiced.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I need planning permission to build my garden office?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s best to check with your local authority \u2013 but in most cases it\u2019s unlikely, unless your garden office is more than 2.0 metres from the boundary of your property, or its overall height is more than 2.5 metres.<\/p>\n<h3>Will I pay business rates on my garden office?<\/h3>\n<p>This depends, and usually a decision is made on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>\n<p>Someone who runs their limited company from home, for example from their living room, won\u2019t qualify to pay business rates. Whereas a beautician who\u2019s turned their garage into a beauty parlor may be subject to business rates because changes have been made to their home.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019d really depend on the scale of your garden office and where you\u2019re based, as every area will have a different outlook.<\/p>\n<h3>Will I pay Capital Gains Tax on my garden office?<\/h3>\n<p>If you sell your property, and your garden office is used exclusively for business use, then yes, you\u2019ll be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/the-basics-of-capital-gains-tax-45500.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subject to Capital Gains Tax<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you do sometimes use it for personal reasons (like to watch the footy!) you won\u2019t be subject to any Capital Gains Tax \u2013 but you will lose out in VAT claims and income tax relief.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting this can get complex \u2013 especially if your garden office building is fixed (so basically, you can\u2019t take it with you!). This is because if the property is sold, it\u2019ll still be part owned by both the limited company and its director\/s. In this instance, it\u2019s best to speak with an accountant for further advice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Need some advice setting up your garden office?
