Everyone will have a different idea of what they want their retirement to look like, whether that be travelling the world on a cruise, or moving to the countryside for some peace and quiet. <\/p>\n<p>Whatever you envision for retired life, pension planning is key to ensuring your vision becomes a reality. Unless of course, you win the lottery beforehand! Just in case that <em>doesn\u2019t<\/em> happen, we\u2019ll discuss how you can start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/how-do-i-retire-from-my-own-business-36676.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">planning your retirement from your business<\/a> today. <\/p>\n<h3>Why should I plan for retirement?<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ve worked hard your whole life; you\u2019ll want to make it all worthwhile, without the stress of money looming over your head. <\/p>\n<p>Think about your goals, do you want to go travelling? Buy a cottage like the one in <em>The Holiday<\/em>? Or simply enjoy life, doing what you want, when you want, without having to worry about the expenses? <\/p>\n<p>Pension and retirement planning will help you understand exactly how much you think you\u2019ll need, and even other things like the age you can actually retire. Proper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/planning-for-the-future-when-youre-self-employed-12458.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">planning for the future<\/a> might even see you bring your retirement plans forward. <\/p>\n<p>For example, you may discover you can retire five years earlier than planned if you can afford to contribute a little bit more each month throughout your working life.  <\/p>\n<p>Once you have clear goals, you can chat with your accountant or financial advisor who can then give you further guidance. <\/p>\n<h3>When should I plan for retirement?<\/h3>\n<p>While there\u2019s no set age, it\u2019s best to start planning sooner rather than later! Once you have a plan in place of what you want to do when you retire, you\u2019ll have a figure to go off which will make it much easier to plan ahead. <\/p>\n<p>Even if you have no idea what you want to do (which is completely normal!), your first step is making sure you&#8217;re enrolled into a pension scheme, such as:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>A workplace pension scheme set up by your employer <\/li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/pensions\/getting-started-with-pensions-for-the-self-employed-26994.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pension scheme you set up yourself if you\u2019re self-employed<\/a>, which you either pay into personally or through your own limited company (or both!) where you can add monthly contributions \u2013 or contribute on an ad hoc basis. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Always ensure you\u2019re reviewing your pension, and speak with your employer or your accountant if you feel you may be better in a different pension scheme. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">If you\u2019re self-employed, check out our beginners\u2019 guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/pensions\/getting-started-with-pensions-for-the-self-employed-26994.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Self-Employed pensions<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>What if I have multiple pension pots?<\/h3>\n<p>The good news is that any pension contributions you\u2019ve made will still count, regardless of how long you were at a company, or how long you were in a particular scheme. <\/p>\n<p>If you were at a company for less than 2 years, you may be entitled to a refund of any contributions you made or, alternatively (and better for that pension pot), you can transfer the value over to your current scheme \u2013 otherwise known as a \u2018cash sum transfer\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of people nowadays have worked with various employers, and even have their own self-employed pensions too. If that\u2019s you, it\u2019s worth considering pension consolidation. <\/p>\n<p>Pension consolidation is where you combine all (or most) of your pension pots into one. This could be better financially, because you\u2019ll normally be paying annual fees across each one. It also helps you track your pension more easily. <\/p>\n<p>Before you do this, speak to an accountant or financial advisor who can help you choose the right scheme to merge your pensions.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How is my pension taxed?<\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, you do need to pay some tax on your pension \u2013 as it\u2019s classed as income! We\u2019ll look at the types of pensions, and how they\u2019re taxed. <\/p>\n<h4>Your state pension<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Your state pension is classed as taxable income, just like your salary from employment. You\u2019ll receive your gross pay (which is the total <em>before<\/em> tax), every 4 weeks. Your tax is paid differently depending on your circumstances.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\" style=\"width:100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"50%\"><strong>Your circumstances<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How you\u2019ll pay tax<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>If the state pension is your only income:<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">If your state pension is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#what-is-the-tax-free-personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">under the Personal Allowance<\/a>, in most instances you don\u2019t need to pay tax.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you do go over your Personal Allowance, HMRC will be in touch with a \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/simple-assessment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Assessment tax bill<\/a>\u2019 which states exactly how much you owe, and how to pay it.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>If you work while claiming your state pension:<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">If you\u2019re employed, it\u2019s business as usual.

It\u2019s important to consider how much you want to take out, and whether or not you\u2019d like to continue to grow your pension. <\/p>\n<h3>Can I claim my pension whilst I\u2019m still working?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can take some of your pension out while you\u2019re still working. If you take no more than the tax-free amount (which is typically up to 25% of your pension pot), you can continue to make pension contributions. <\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll still be able to pay either your annual allowance of \u00a360,000 per tax year (or 100% of your salary if it\u2019s less than this), and benefit from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-i-need-to-declare-payments-into-a-private-pension-on-my-tax-return-180750.html#pension-contribution-tax-relief\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">relief on your contributions<\/a>. <\/p>\n<h3>Are there tax implications to claiming my pension early?<\/h3>\n<p>It depends on how much you plan to take out. If you take out a lump sum of up to 25%, it\u2019s tax free, but if you go over this amount \u2013 you\u2019ll need to pay tax on it. If you\u2019re still working, this could push you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-is-the-40-tax-bracket-233267.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">into the higher tax bracket<\/a>, so spreading the withdrawals over a few years is more beneficial! <\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t always the solution for everyone \u2013 and your personal circumstances could mean it&#8217;s essential for you to draw out more. If this is the case, speak with an accountant who can guide you through the most tax-efficient way to withdrawing your pension. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accountancy services for businesses.
