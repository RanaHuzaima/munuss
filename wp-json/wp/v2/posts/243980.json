They have authority over their audience, usually homing in on a particular niche, for example food, fashion or beauty.<\/p>\n<p>There are different levels of influencers depending on their reach and how many followers they have. <\/p>\n<p>It goes in the order of:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mega influencers<\/li>\n<li>Macro influencers<\/li>\n<li>Micro influencers<\/li>\n<li>Nano-influencers <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you\u2019re more of a \u2018nano-influencer\u2019 you may be wondering whether you\u2019re influencing as a hobby, or you\u2019re trading. Keep reading to find out whether you should be registering your earnings with HMRC. <\/p>\n<h3>How do I know if I\u2019m influencing as a hobby or trading?<\/h3>\n<p>Truth be told, we can\u2019t give you a definitive answer \u2013 as the lines are often blurred when it comes to what counts as trading, and what doesn\u2019t. There are telltale signs you can go off though.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you receive a free meal out in return for some video content from time to time, or you receive \u00a350 to promote a product, maybe once a month or a few times a year \u2013 chances are you\u2019re <em>not<\/em> trading.<\/p>\n<p>But if you are purposely building a strong media presence, with a strategy in place and regular clients who pay you to promote their services \u2013 you may <em>likely<\/em> be trading.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, influencers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/freelancer\/side-hustle\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-on-my-hobby-side-business-13671.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">start the job off as a hobby before it turns into a business that\u2019s trading<\/a>. If you feel you\u2019re stuck in between, it\u2019s important to note you\u2019ll need to let HMRC know if you:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Make over your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax-free trading allowance<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Begin to get regular clients <\/li>\n<li>If influencing becomes a regular source of income for you <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note, just because you need to inform HMRC of your earnings, doesn\u2019t always necessarily mean you\u2019ll need to pay tax, or that you\u2019re officially trading (it can still be just a hobby that makes you a little more than the trading allowance allows). Whether or not you pay tax, depends on your profits, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which tax bracket you fall into<\/a>.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>How do influencers generate income?<\/h4>\n<p>The world of influencing can be confusing, and you may have thought at first, <em>can I really generate income from just views alone?<\/em> The answer is yes, you can! <\/p>\n<p>Here are ways to earn money as a social media influencer:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>You can earn money based on content views and followers (you will need to ensure you\u2019re eligible though, for example if you film content for TikTok, ensure you\u2019re on the TikTok creator fund, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/does-my-small-business-need-to-sell-on-tiktok-229418.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set up a TikTok Shop to sell products<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Affiliate links (this is where you\u2019ll advertise a product and have a specific link to give your followers, that way if they buy the product, you receive commission) <\/li>\n<li>Businesses may pay you to film content via a \u2018paid partnership\u2019<\/li>\n<li>You may be gifted a product or experience <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Always remember to comply by advertising rules, such as clearly disclosing paid partnerships and gifted items.<\/div>\n<h3>Should I register my influencer business with HMRC? <\/h3>\n<p>If you believe you\u2019re trading, and you\u2019ve earned over the tax-free trading allowance, you\u2019ll need to let HMRC know. <\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s not as easy as registering as an influencer \u2013 you\u2019ll need to decide on a legal business structure. But once you\u2019ve decided which business structure you\u2019d prefer, it\u2019s less confusing as there are rules on exactly what you need to submit, and the taxes you\u2019ll need to pay (as well as the deadlines).<\/p>\n<p>The most common business structures for influencers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/soletrader\/how-do-i-become-a-sole-trader-72592.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sole trader<\/a> businesses, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/how-to-register-as-a-limited-company-in-the-uk-60721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">limited companies<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>If you decide to trade as yourself, rather than as a company, you\u2019ll be a sole trader \u2013 this means you\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/registering\/how-does-a-sole-trader-register-for-self-assessment-14776.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for Self Assessment<\/a> and pay income tax and National Insurance contributions. This can be great for influencers, because you essentially \u2018are\u2019 the business (in a legal sense), and you can keep all of your profits after tax. <\/p>\n<p>As things get bigger, and you hire moderators and begin to get brand deals, it may be time to switch to a limited company. A limited company is a separate entity to yourself, which offers you more protection if your business gets into debt or has any legal trouble. It can also be more tax efficient, depending on how much you\u2019re earning. In this instance you\u2019ll submit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Company Tax Returns and pay Corporation Tax<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">We have a guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/which-legal-structure-should-i-choose-when-i-start-a-business-14385.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">choosing a legal business structure <\/a>that will help you decide.<\/div>\n<h3>Do I pay tax on gifted items?<\/h3>\n<p>When you have actual money in your bank account, it\u2019s much easier to work out how much tax you need to pay. But gifted items are where it gets tricky. Any goods, or services you may receive for free to endorse are classed as a \u2018Payments in Kind\u2019 (PIK). <em>Even<\/em> if the product you\u2019ve received is completely out the blue.<\/p>\n<p>When it\u2019s time to complete your Self Assessment, any Payments in Kind will need to be included in your figures when calculating your income.
