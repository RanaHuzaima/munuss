This is largely down to the fact influencers don\u2019t always receive cash in their bank for the work they do. Instead, it could be a free PR gift to review, or a complimentary service to vlog about (such as a meal at a restaurant, spa treatment, or even a holiday abroad). <\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some of those gifts won&#8217;t be tax-free, and you&#8217;re legally required to declare any taxable gifts you receive. So let&#8217;s go over it all in more detail.<\/p>\n<h3>Do influencers pay tax?<\/h3>\n<p>You can earn up to \u00a31,000 of miscellaneous income every tax year, without needing to tell HMRC or pay tax on it. Known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Trading Allowance<\/a>, the term &#8216;miscellaneous income&#8217; includes earnings from casual self-employment. <\/p>\n<p>If you go over the \u00a31,000 threshold then you might need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-influencers-pay-tax-243980.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit a tax return to tell HMRC about what you earn as an influencer<\/a> but this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;ll need to pay tax on those earnings.<\/p>\n<p>It all depends on how much profit you make. If your total earnings for the year are within the personal allowance (this is the amount of tax-free income you can have in one year), you won\u2019t pay tax, but anything over this will be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#income-tax\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taxed based on which tax band it falls into<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t panic if your income is in the higher rate band! You\u2019ll only pay the higher rate of tax on the earnings which fall within that tax bracket, and not on all of your income! <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">It\u2019s super important to ensure you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim any expenses<\/a>, so you <em>don\u2019t<\/em> end up paying more tax than you need to.<\/div>\n<h3>Do I need to pay tax on PR gifts?<\/h3>\n<p><em>Sometimes<\/em>. Basically, HMRC are interested in any PR gift you receive that leads to personal gain or offers commercial benefit. There are instances where a PR gift is unlikely to be subjected to tax. <\/p>\n<p>For example, if a brand gifts you something <em>freely<\/em>, without any obligation to promote it then this might have an impact, but other factors come into play too, such as <em>value<\/em>. <\/p>\n<p>Some PR gifts will be subject to tax if their value reaches a specific threshold, while others may be tax-free \u2013 it\u2019s always best checking with an accountant if you\u2019re unsure before ruling anything out! The rules are pretty complicated. Any gifts you receive that are considered a form of payment are known as payments in kind.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/who-we-help\/self-employed-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Accountancy services for the self-employed<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What are payments in kind?<\/h3>\n<p>Payments in kind are a gift or free service given as form of payment instead of actual cash or money in the bank. <\/p>\n<p>Receiving the gift as a \u2018payment\u2019 is the key point \u2013 if it\u2019s just a gift from a friend or family member, which isn\u2019t in return for anything, and doesn\u2019t benefit or promote something, it\u2019s completely tax-free! <\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a social media influencer in the beauty industry. You receive PR gifts from multiple brands but some won\u2019t need to be declared. For instance, random packages that contain small products with a value of under \u00a350 that you don\u2019t promote or post about.  <em>Others must be declared to HMRC<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>For example<\/h4>\n<p>A brand reaches out to you about promoting their premium skin care range that retails at \u00a3120. You\u2019ll receive the products for free as long as you create and publish a short <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/does-my-small-business-need-to-sell-on-tiktok-229418.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" a style=\"color: #3669A4; text-decoration: underline;\">Tik Tok<\/a> video, along with a link to the product for your audience to purchase.  <\/p>\n<p>HMRC will likely class this as a Payment in Kind (PIK) \u2013 which is a use of goods (or a service, such as tickets somewhere or an invitation to eat out for free) <em>instead<\/em> of a cash payment.\n<\/div>\n<p>As a social media influencer, you\u2019re likely to post about all kinds of things \u2013 even experiences and products that <em>haven\u2019t<\/em> been gifted. It\u2019s important to always put a disclaimer on any gifted products and tell your audience whether your content is or isn\u2019t promotional. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s beneficial for your personal brand to keep things authentic with your audience, and also provides proof to HMRC that you were not gifted or paid. Especially if you do go on to work with that brand in the future, and it looks like previous posts weren\u2019t declared honestly as gifts or ads. <\/p>\n<p>Any non-gifted products you review online (that you\u2019ve purchased <em>purely<\/em> for content purposes) can be claimed back as a business expense! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Efficient bookkeeping can help you keep track of this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I have to declare all my PR gifts to HMRC?<\/h3>\n<p>HMRC don\u2019t need to know about all of your PR gifts, only the ones that are subject to taxes. It\u2019s always best to check with an accountant first, but HMRC will mainly go off three key details, which we explain below.<\/p>\n<h4>Cash value<\/h4>\n<p>If you receive a tangible PR gift (this would be something like a product or service), and it\u2019s worth more than \u00a350, it\u2019ll be subject to tax. If it\u2019s under \u00a350, you likely won\u2019t need to pay any tax on it \u2013 <em>but it\u2019s still important to check<\/em>. Tax is complicated!<\/p>\n<h4>Type of gift<\/h4>\n<p>Can you exchange the gift for a cash sum? For example, a spa day or tickets to a football match. If the answer is yes, it\u2019s likely taxable. There are exceptions though, such as non-transferable tickets to an event. <\/p>\n<h4>Purpose<\/h4>\n<p>This is the easiest way to identify whether your PR gift is subject to tax. What are the intentions behind the gift? For instance, if you are gifted a PR item worth over \u00a350, with the intention to endorse the product on social media it\u2019s then classed as a non-monetary payment which is subject to tax. <\/p>\n<p>Like anything though, there are exemptions. If you\u2019re gifted something personally instead of for commercial purposes (for example, a brand sends you a gift for your birthday with no expectations for you to promote it), it\u2019ll be tax-free \u2013 just remember to keep proof! <\/p>\n<h3>Who determines whether a PR gift is taxable?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s your responsibility to determine whether a PR gift is taxable \u2013 if you\u2019re ever unsure, speak with your accountant. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth considering PR gifts and whether or not you\u2019d like to accept them. One reason is for your brand (you don\u2019t want to start promoting something completely random your audience aren\u2019t interested in), and another is for tax purposes. If it\u2019s a large gift, are you prepared to pay tax on it? <\/p>\n<h4>Are there any penalties if I don\u2019t declare some of my PR gifts?<\/h4>\n<p>If HMRC inspect your income and find you haven\u2019t declared all of your taxable PR gifts \u2013 then you could face penalties. <em>How much<\/em> depends on whether HMRC believe it was a mistake or not. <\/p>\n<p>If they believe it was a mistake, the penalty will be between 0 and 30% of the tax amount, but if they believe it was concealed, you could face a penalty of up to 100% &#8211; on top of the tax which you owe.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I pay tax on my PR gifts?<\/h3>\n<p>Any PR gifts classed as a \u2018Payment in Kind\u2019 will need to be declared on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/checklist-for-completion-of-self-assessment-tax-return-2831.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Self Assessment tax return<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Do you need help figuring out if your PR gifts are payments in kind?
