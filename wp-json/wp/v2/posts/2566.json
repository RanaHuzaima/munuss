Self-employed people don\u2019t have quite the same level of luxury, and working for yourself means that taxes, tax returns, and all that fun stuff are your responsibility. <\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re brand new to all this it can be a bit confusing trying to work out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/key-accounting-and-tax-year-dates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what you need to submit, when, and who to<\/a>. These are the kinds of questions we answer all the time, so in this article we go over some of the most common types of tax returns affecting small businesses, and which ones you should have on your radar.<\/p>\n<h3>Self Assessment<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll normally need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit a Self Assessment tax return<\/a> if you receive an income and it\u2019s not already taxed elsewhere (such as by your employer). This might be because you\u2019ve registered for self-employment as a sole trader, as a partner in a partnership, or because you\u2019re a company shareholder and receive dividend payments. <\/p>\n<p>The money you earn might not be your only source of income. For example, someone who works for their employer full-time might still need to submit a Self Assessment tax return <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-on-my-hobby-side-business-13671.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if they also earn money from a side-hustle<\/a>. If your self-employed income is less than \u00a31,000 in a tax year you might not need to register (or pay tax) \u2013 all thanks to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trading Allowance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Self Assessment <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/registering\/do-i-need-to-register-for-self-assessment-if-im-not-self-employed-3839.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">isn\u2019t just for self-employed people<\/a> though. You might also need to submit this type of tax return if you earn more than \u00a3100,000 per year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/can-i-claim-child-benefit-if-im-self-employed-279.html#high-income-child-benefit-charge\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">receive Child Benefit whilst earning more than \u00a360,000 a year<\/a>, or even if you receive an income from renting out a property.<\/p>\n<h4>When do I need to send my Self Assessment tax return?<\/h4>\n<p>The Self Assessment deadline is different depending on how you choose to submit your tax return. At the moment you can still submit paper-based tax returns, although HMRC do place more emphasis on submitting online, and are still planning to introduce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/making-tax-digital-for-income-tax-self-assessments\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment (MTD ITSA)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Submit a paper-based Self Assessment tax return:<\/strong> If you prefer to file a paper tax return while you still can, make sure HMRC receive it no later than 31st October following the end of the tax year being reported on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Online Self Assessment tax returns:<\/strong> Most people submit their Self Assessment online and the deadline for this is 31st January following the end of the tax year being reported on (so you get three extra months if you submit online rather than by post).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The deadline to pay your Self Assessment tax bill is 31st January no matter which method you use to submit your tax return. <\/p>\n<h4>Payments on account<\/h4>\n<p>If your Self Assessment tax bill comes to more than \u00a31,000 HMRC will ask you to make an advance payment towards next year\u2019s bill. Known as \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/payments-on-account\/what-are-payments-on-account-7074.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payments on account<\/a>\u2019, the amount they ask you to pay towards next year is equivalent to half of this year\u2019s bill \u2013 whatever that amount might be. <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>1st payment on account:<\/strong> The deadline for paying the first installment is 31st January \u2013 the same deadline for submitting and paying the bill for this year\u2019s tax return.

The process for this partly depends on the way in which you pay yourself from the business.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submits a Company Tax Return, and pays Corporation Tax<\/a> on its profits<\/li>\n<li>If you take a salary from the business as a company director, you might need to report this through PAYE <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-most-tax-efficient-directors-salary-in-2022_23-51622.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">depending on how much you earn<\/a><\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re also a company shareholder and receive dividends, you\u2019ll need to submit a Self Assessment tax return to report these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/paying-tax-on-dividends-in-2022-23-56115.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and pay dividend tax<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Company Tax Return deadlines<\/h4>\n<p>The submission deadline for a Company Tax Return is 12 months after the end of the accounting period which it relates to ended. The limited company will need to pay Corporation Tax on any profits that it makes in that period. If a company\u2019s taxable profits are:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>\u00a31.5 million or less<\/strong>, then the tax bill must be paid within 9 months and 1 day after the close of the accounting period. <\/li>\n<li><strong>More than \u00a31.5 million<\/strong>, Corporation Tax will need to be paid in instalments, each with its own respective deadline.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>VAT Return<\/h3>\n<p>Some businesses choose to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/should-i-voluntarily-register-for-vat-early-14770.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for VAT on a voluntary basis<\/a> because it\u2019s more tax efficient for them, but VAT registration isn\u2019t compulsory unless your taxable turnover meets the \u00a390,000 registration threshold in a 12-month period.<\/p>\n<p>Once you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-do-i-register-for-vat-our-guide-to-vat-registration-93406.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for VAT<\/a> you\u2019ll need to submit regular VAT returns to report the VAT that you collect on sales, and what you pay on any business purchases. <\/p>\n<p>There are different types of VAT scheme available, some of which have various reporting deadlines, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/the-different-types-of-vat-schemes-119533.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">so double check the requirements for the VAT scheme that you use<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>PAYE<\/h3>\n<p>This is one for the employers (or if you\u2019re the director of your own limited company, and pay yourself a salary through PAYE). PAYE (it stands for Pay As You Earn) is the process employers use to collect income tax, National Insurance, and other contributions from their employees\u2019 pay. Employers report all this information to HMRC each time they pay their staff, and pay on any deductions they make.
