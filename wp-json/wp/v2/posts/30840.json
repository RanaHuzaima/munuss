In this article we explain what to do next, depending on what type of business structure they operated.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/inheritance-tax-for-businesses-14717.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">looking into Business Relief<\/a>, which may be able to offer tax relief against Inheritance Tax relating to the business.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to tell HMRC or Companies House when a business owner dies?<\/h3>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/after-a-death\/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once?step-by-step\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tell Us Once service<\/a> to report a death to multiple government agencies in one go, <strong>although this doesn&#8217;t include Companies House<\/strong>, so you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/companieshouse.blog.gov.uk\/2019\/11\/14\/how-to-prepare-for-the-death-of-a-director\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">do this separately if the person who died operated a limited company<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>You can still contact HMRC directly if you need help, and they will also let you know what to do about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-a-self-assessment-tax-return-for-someone-who-has-died-98638.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submitting a tax return for someone who has died<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>The situation for sole traders<\/h3>\n<p>In the event of a sole trader passing away, the business essentially dies with them. Their business isn&#8217;t legally separate from them personally, so any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-are-business-assets-86076.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">assets the business owned<\/a> (or liabilities) will automatically become part of their estate when they die. <\/p>\n<p>Assets can be sold to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/accounting-faqs-what-is-a-liability-64476.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clear any liabilities such debts<\/a> or outstanding balances like loans, mortgages, employee wages, or unpaid invoices. Anything that&#8217;s left will go to the beneficiaries of their estate.<\/p>\n<h3>Sudden deaths and partnerships<\/h3>\n<p>A business partnership will normally dissolve on the death of one of the partners. Hopefully there will be an up-to-date partnership agreement in place which addresses what happens to any assets or profits in the event that one of the partners dies. <\/p>\n<p>If there isn&#8217;t an agreement in place, their share of the partnership&#8217;s assets will become probate property and pass to any beneficiaries of their estate. If it&#8217;s financially viable to do so, the remaining partner(s) might decide to make an offer to buy the portion which belonged to the person who died, but ultimately it&#8217;s up to the person (or people) who inherit to decide what happens to it.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What about limited companies?<\/h3>\n<p>A limited company is a separate legal entity in its own right, so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-happens-if-a-director-or-shareholder-dies-199591.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the death of a director or shareholder<\/a> can be a bit more complicated. In general, it&#8217;s worth noting the difference between a shareholder and a director. A shareholder owns a share of the business personally, and these shares will form part of their estate. A director is responsible for running the business.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s well worth checking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-model-articles-of-association-in-a-limited-company-196848.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the most recent Articles of Association<\/a> relating to the company. These are basically the written rules that a company uses to explain what powers directors have, and what the shareholders are entitled to, so there&#8217;s usually a section dealing with the death of anyone in the company.<\/p>\n<h3>So, how can you make sure you\u2019re prepared&#8230; just in case?<\/h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Invest in a good life insurance plan \u2013 this will be a massive financial relief for those left behind<\/li>\n<li>Set out clear contracts while you\u2019re alive and well, and have everything witnessed or approved as needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online accounting services<\/a>.
