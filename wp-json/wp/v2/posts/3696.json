When most people come to us to talk about tax, they\u2019re usually referring to the tax they need to pay on their income or through their business.<\/p>\n<p>With everyone\u2019s circumstances being so different it\u2019s difficult to give a specific answer, but we can explain how the tax calculation process works for some of the most common types. You can also use our handy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online tax calculators<\/a> to hopefully give you a clearer idea.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting one common area of confusion. If you earn enough to become a higher rate taxpayer, it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll need to pay 40% tax on <em>all<\/em> your income. Instead, the 40% rate will only apply to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-is-the-40-tax-bracket-233267.html#how-much-do-i-have-to-earn-to-be-in-the-40-tax-bracket\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the part of your earnings which falls into the higher rate tax band<\/a> (which, for 2024\/25 is \u00a350,271 - \u00a3125,140).<\/p>\n<h3>How much tax will I pay if I\u2019m employed?<\/h3>\n<p>This usually depends on how much you earn, and how your employer pays you. When you\u2019re employed, your employer deducts income tax and National Insurance (NI) contributions from your wages before your pay goes into your bank account. They pay this on to HMRC through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/getting-started-with-pay-as-you-earn-paye\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pay As You Earn (PAYE)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some people also receive taxable benefits as part of their employment package, such as a company car or private healthcare. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Benefits in Kind<\/a> (BiKs for short) aren&#8217;t part of your wages as such, but they do have a financial worth, so you&#8217;ll pay tax on the equivalent value. Your employer will report these either through payroll or by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-is-a-p11d-form-31299.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submitting a P11D form<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although your employer calculates what you owe and submits this information to HMRC, it\u2019s still your responsibility to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/income-tax\/what-is-a-tax-code-14789.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">make sure that you&#8217;re on the right tax code<\/a> and paying the correct amount. The good news is that taxpayers receive an annual <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Personal Allowance<\/a>, which is currently \u00a312,570.<\/p>\n<h4>What will I pay if I earn more than the Personal Allowance?<\/h4>\n<p>This depends on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#income-tax\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which income tax band you fall into<\/a>.

How much tax will I pay?<\/h3>\n<p>Starting your own business can be an appealing thought, with the promise of more flexibility for arranging your time and choosing the projects you want to work on. But getting your head around the tax implications of being self-employed can be a bit confusing. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/starting-a-new-business\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Starting a New Business<\/a> to see what\u2019s what.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nAs a starting point though, the tax that you pay as a self-employed person depends on what sort of business structure you decide to use, and how much you earn through self-employment. For instance:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>A self-employed sole trader normally needs to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit a Self Assessment tax return<\/a>, and pay income tax and National Insurance on their self-employed earnings<\/li>\n<li>Someone who owns and runs a limited company will need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit a Company Tax Return<\/a> so the company can pay the right amount of Corporation Tax on its profits. They might also need to submit PAYE returns if they take a salary as a director, and submit Self Assessment returns if they take dividends!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your personal allowance of \u00a312,570 stays the same, regardless of whether you\u2019re self-employed or employed. Remember though, the personal allowance will reduce by \u00a31 for every \u00a32 you earn above \u00a3100,000.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth remembering that when you\u2019re self-employed, you\u2019re responsible for submitting your own tax returns and for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/key-accounting-and-tax-year-dates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paying the bill on time<\/a>. This means excellent record-keeping skills are essential if you\u2019re to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/common-tax-return-errors-and-how-to-avoid-them-40118.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">avoid the most common tax return errors<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h4>I have two jobs &#8211; one employed and one self-employed.

You\u2019ll receive the allowance against your total amount of income for the year, whether you earn it through employment, self-employment, or a combination. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t get a new allowance for each type of income!<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trading Allowance means you may be able to earn up to \u00a31,000 from self-employment<\/a> before you need to tell HMRC and start paying tax on it, even if you also have employment income. You can also claim tax relief on your business expenses. Allowable expenses can include all sorts, as long as it\u2019s purely for business use.
