Whether you want to supplement your pension by earning extra cash or explore new skills, there are lots of opportunities available \u2013 including self-employment.<\/p>\n<p>But what does this mean for your pension and paying tax? We look at what to consider if you\u2019re planning to be your own boss after retiring.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the advantages of being self-employed after retirement?<\/h3>\n<p>There are all sorts of reasons why you might want to become self-employed after you\u2019ve retired.<\/p>\n<h4>Find a new focus<\/h4>\n<p>Retirement often opens doors to new interests and hobbies that you just didn\u2019t have time for before. Many retired people find themselves drawn to self-employment as a way of staying active, engaged, and financially independent. Whether it&#8217;s consulting in a field of expertise or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-start-a-business-from-scratch-74629.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launching a startup<\/a>, self-employment can be a great way to explore newfound passions and discover a renewed sense of purpose.<\/p>\n<h4>Supplement retirement income<\/h4>\n<p>With the cost of living ever rising, you might want to find additional sources of income to supplement your retirement fund.<\/p>\n<h4>Get a sense of flexibility and autonomy<\/h4>\n<p>One of the most enticing aspects of self-employment is the freedom it gives you. You can pick your own projects and working hours, and work from anywhere. It can be the perfect work\/life balance, with plenty of time left to do what you want to do, without the constraints of a traditional job.<\/p>\n<h4>Turn hobbies into cash<\/h4>\n<p>Whether you really need the cash or not, it can be fun to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-on-my-hobby-side-business-13671.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">turn hobbies and interests into profitable ventures<\/a>. Basically, it\u2019s great to get a kick out of making money from something you love doing! Not only that, but it can also enhance overall wellbeing and satisfaction in retirement.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/startup-business-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Startup accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only <strike>\u00a354.50<\/strike> \u00a332.70 per month <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Will my pension be affected if I become self-employed after retiring?<\/h3>\n<p>Deciding to work for yourself after you retire won\u2019t affect the pension payments you\u2019re entitled to, but it might affect the amount of tax you pay.<\/p>\n<p>Pensions (including the State Pension) are taxable, so any you receive will be added to your self-employment income to work out how much tax you need to pay. You\u2019ll pay tax on any earnings you receive above <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the \u00a312,570 tax-free personal allowance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>How much tax will I pay?<\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/how-much-tax-will-i-pay-3696.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">amount of tax you pay<\/a> depends on how much you earn during the tax year. Self-employed people pay income tax based on the same rates and thresholds as employees, so that won\u2019t change.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trading Allowance<\/a> you can receive up to \u00a31,000 of trading or casual income in a tax year and you won\u2019t need to pay tax on it, or even tell HMRC. You\u2019re entitled to the Trading Allowance even if you receive money from other sources, such as wages from an employer or pension payments.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">You\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/registering\/how-does-a-sole-trader-register-for-self-assessment-14776.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">register for Self Assessment<\/a> if your self-employed income crosses the \u00a31,000 threshold.<\/div>\n<h4>What about National Insurance?<\/h4>\n<p>The good news is that you won\u2019t pay National Insurance once you reach State Pension age. If you\u2019re already self-employed, you\u2019ll continue paying <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/national-insurance\/for-self-employed-businesses-22965.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Class 4 National Insurance contributions<\/a> until the end of the tax year in which you reached State Pension age. A tax year runs from 6th April to 5th April.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>For example<\/h4>\n<p>Your birthday is 18th May, and you reach State Pension age in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>This means you reach the age threshold in the 2024\/25 tax year, so you\u2019ll continue making Class 4 contributions until 5th April 2025.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Before becoming self-employed after retirement, it\u2019s worth thinking about your financial situation and what you\u2019re hoping to achieve. Consider your retirement savings, pensions, benefits, and outgoings. Creating a realistic budget and financial plan will help mitigate risks and make sure you\u2019ve got all financial bases covered.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I pay tax if I work for myself after retiring?<\/h3>\n<p>Self Assessment is the system HMRC use to collect tax on earnings that haven\u2019t already been taxed elsewhere. If you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/soletrader\/how-do-i-become-a-sole-trader-72592.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">become a self-employed sole trader<\/a> and earn more than the Trading Allowance, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/self-assessment-for-the-self-employed-16172.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">submit a Self Assessment tax return<\/a> to tell HMRC about all of the money you earn (from every source).<\/p>\n<p>HMRC will use this information to calculate your tax bill, but you won\u2019t be taxed again on pension income which your provider has already deducted tax on. Your pension provider will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/what-is-a-p60-for-3738.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issue a P60 end of tax year certificate<\/a> to show how much tax you\u2019ve paid (if any).<\/p>\n<h3>Can I continue making pension contributions?<\/h3>\n<p>Some pension providers do allow you to carry on making contributions after retirement age, so it\u2019s worth checking the terms of your policy if this is something you\u2019re interested in.<\/p>\n<p>It could potentially increase your retirement savings, but if you&#8217;re drawing from your pension while self-employed, you may need to carefully manage your withdrawals to make sure you balance your income needs against your tax liabilities.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I become self-employed?<\/h3>\n<p>The route to self-employment involves lots of decisions based on your individual circumstances, so it looks a bit different for everyone. There\u2019s certainly lots of think about! From what kind of business you want to start, to pension and tax implications, it can all be a bit of confusing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-start-a-business-from-scratch-74629.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top tips for starting a business<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>Business mentoring and networking<\/h4>\n<p>Organisations like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fsb.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federation of Small Businesses (FSB)<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bgateway.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Gateway<\/a>, and local chambers of commerce offer mentoring programs, networking events, and workshops tailored to aspiring entrepreneurs.
