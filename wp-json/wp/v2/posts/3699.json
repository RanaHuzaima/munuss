Each option has its pros and cons depending on your personal circumstances and how you want to do business, so what\u2019s special about being a sole trader? To help you weigh up your options as a self-employed sole trader, we\u2019ll go over the potential advantages and disadvantages. <\/p>\n<h3>What does it mean to be a sole trader?<\/h3>\n<p>Sole traders are self-employed people who own and run their business without any legal distinction between themselves and the business. As a sole trader you \u2018are\u2019 the business, and this has an impact on your responsibilities and the way you pay tax.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the advantages of registering as a sole trader?<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of people decide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/soletrader\/how-do-i-become-a-sole-trader-72592.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set up a self-employed business as a sole trader<\/a>, and it\u2019s one of the most popular structures in the UK for several reasons. <\/p>\n<h4>It\u2019s easy to register as a sole trader<\/h4>\n<p>One of the benefits of being a sole trader is that registering the business is incredibly straightforward. You\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/how-does-a-sole-trader-register-for-self-assessment-14776.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register as a sole trader for Self Assessment<\/a> so that HMRC know you\u2019re self-employed, but beyond that you\u2019re ready to go. <\/p>\n<p>You won\u2019t need to register with Companies House like a limited company does. Sole traders don\u2019t even need <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bank-accounts\/do-i-need-a-business-bank-account-7561.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a separate business bank account<\/a>, though it\u2019s good practice to have a separate account for your business transactions.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be registered under your own name because you are the business, but you can choose a different name to trade under. Just remember that you\u2019ll still need to include both names on anything official, such as customer invoices.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/sole-trader-accounting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Sole Trader accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>There isn\u2019t quite so much admin<\/h4>\n<p>One of the benefits of operating as a sole trader is that you\u2019ll normally only need to submit Self Assessment tax returns so that HMRC can work out how much tax you owe (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-happens-if-i-pay-too-much-tax-3729.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">or if you\u2019ve paid too much<\/a>!).<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DXEs3aZjlNI?si=V_FqnIVKt5mmNI1t\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nLimited companies can be a bit more complicated, with shares to issue, directors to appoint, and extra reporting requirements to think about.<\/p>\n<p>Just remember that like any type of business, sole traders still need to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">robust bookkeeping processes<\/a> in place. It\u2019s an essential part of submitting accurate tax returns, and you can use your financial data to help you make plans and more effective decisions. <\/p>\n<h4>Sole traders don\u2019t have to share information publicly<\/h4>\n<p>As a sole trader you don\u2019t need to register your business with Companies House like a limited company does, so you won\u2019t appear on the public register. Your personal details and business information are kept private \u2013 which might be particularly good news <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-on-my-hobby-side-business-13671.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you\u2019re running a side-hustle in your spare time<\/a> and don\u2019t want your boss to know! <\/p>\n<h4>It\u2019s easier for sole traders to pay themselves<\/h4>\n<p>There\u2019s no separation between you and your sole trader business, so you can simply keep any profits for yourself. This can have its downsides though, because you\u2019ll pay tax on your profits whether or not you take them out the business. There might also come a point <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-operating-as-a-limited-company-14752.html#better-tax-efficiency-and-planning\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">when it\u2019s more tax efficient to switch your business over and operate as a limited company instead<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>You can change your structure more easily<\/h4>\n<p>Dissolving a limited company in order to become a sole trader can be a long-winded process, but making the switch <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/incorporating-a-limited-company\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">from being a sole trader to incorporating a limited company<\/a> is much more straightforward. <\/p>\n<h4>Being a sole trader doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re alone<\/h4>\n<p>Just because you\u2019re a sole trader, it doesn\u2019t mean that you need to do everything yourself. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/soletrader\/can-you-employ-people-as-a-sole-trader-13871.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sole traders can still employ other people<\/a> if they want to (and of course, you can still <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-you-need-to-know-about-hiring-an-accountant-88629.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ask for professional help from your accountant<\/a> when you need it!).<\/p>\n<h3>What are the drawbacks of being a sole trader?<\/h3>\n<p>Some aspects of being a sole trader might be a disadvantage depending on your circumstances, or even on the nature of your business.<\/p>\n<h4>You\u2019ll be personally liable for any debts<\/h4>\n<p>Without that legal separation between you and your sole trader business, you\u2019ll be personally liable for any debts or other issues that come up. If the type of work that you\u2019re doing is particularly high-risk in terms of finances, then operating as a limited company will help to protect your personal assets if things do go wrong.<\/p>\n<h4>It might be less tax efficient<\/h4>\n<p>Sole traders pay tax on the profits they make, whether or not they actually take money out of the business for themselves. Whilst this does mean it\u2019s simpler to pay yourself, it also means you\u2019ll need to pay income tax on everything.<\/p>\n<p>In a limited company the business pays Corporation Tax on its profits, and then you can choose to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-most-tax-efficient-directors-salary-in-2022_23-51622.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">take a combination of a salary and dividends<\/a> if you want to. Paying yourself like this can actually be far more tax efficient, because dividends are subject to a lower rate of tax than other types of income.<\/p>\n<h4>You may find it more difficult to get finance or funding<\/h4>\n<p>Sole traders are just as entitled as anyone else to apply for business loans, start a crowdfunding campaign, or look for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/fundraising-and-finance\/funding-options-for-small-businesses-36678.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">other forms of financial input<\/a>. It can be a bit trickier if you\u2019re looking for investment though. <\/p>\n<p>As a sole trader you can\u2019t offer shares in your business like a limited company can, so it\u2019s more difficult to attract potential investors.<\/p>\n<h4>It might be harder to pitch for particular jobs<\/h4>\n<p>Operating as a limited company can give the impression of a more stable and established business. There\u2019s also more accountability because your information and business records are available through Companies House, where any interested (or simply nosy) party can take a look at you. This means that you might find some clients and suppliers will only work with limited companies, particularly if you\u2019re applying for tenders.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our sole trader accounting services.
