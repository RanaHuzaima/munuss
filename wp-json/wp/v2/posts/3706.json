The good news is that some of these training costs might be eligible for tax relief so you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim the expense against your tax bill<\/a>. As ever, there are certain rules about what qualifies as an allowable training expense, so we&#8217;ll explain what you might be able to claim.<\/p>\n<h3>What kind of courses and training can I claim as an expense?<\/h3>\n<p>The rules around claiming expenses for training courses are fairly restrictive, so you won&#8217;t be able to claim for everything that takes your fancy. <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The general rule for training expenses is that they relate to and support your existing business.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThis means a claim for training expenses is only allowable if the course or learning relates to a business which you already run, but it doesn&#8217;t include taking that business in a brand new direction or for a business which you haven&#8217;t started yet.<\/p>\n<p>According to HMRC, your training course might be an allowable expense if it&#8217;s designed to help you:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Improve the existing skills and knowledge you already use in your business.<\/strong> For example, a wedding photographer who takes a refresher course on using photo editing software to update their existing skills.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stay current with the technology used in your industry.<\/strong> For instance, someone who installs gas boilers undertaking training to fit heat pump systems because these are a new technology offered as a replacement to gas boilers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Learn new skills so you can keep up with changes in your industry.<\/strong> HMRC use the example of a website designer who goes on a course to learn about using AI functionality in the websites they build.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Develop new skills and knowledge to support your business.<\/strong> For example, a plumber who goes on a bookkeeping course to help them manage their business admin, or a market trader who goes on a training session to learn more about ecommerce and online marketplaces so they can increase their sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What training expenses can&#8217;t I claim for?<\/h3>\n<p>You might decide to go on all sorts of courses and training sessions, but you wont be able to claim them as a business expense if they&#8217;re totally unrelated to the industry you work in, or if you&#8217;re planning to use your new skills to start a new business. <\/p>\n<p>Even if the course relates to your industry, it only counts as an allowable training expense if it supports the current aims of your business.<\/p>\n<p>HMRC give the example of someone who sells sports clothing enrolling on a sports science degree. The nature of their course might be related to the sports sector they work in, but it won&#8217;t help them to sell more sportswear so they won&#8217;t be able to claim.<\/p>\n<h3>Are there any restrictions on who provides the training?<\/h3>\n<p>Not as such, but if HMRC ask to see some receipts and it turns out your mate Barry delivered the training in the pub one night, you&#8217;re probably going to end up in trouble. <\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, training can be delivered online, in-person, or as part of a distance-learning programme, and might be delivered by a registered body, or as part of a webinar hosted by others in the industry.<\/p>\n<h3>Are there additional costs I can claim for too?<\/h3>\n<p>Again, this depends! For example, if you made a journey outside of your normal travel so you could attend the course, you might also be able to claim your travel costs, or your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/what-can-i-claim-for-food-1420.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">food and drink expenses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
