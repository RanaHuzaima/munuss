Fortunately, you may be able to claim a refund if you overpay the tax you owe to HMRC. It\u2019s not as uncommon as you might think, so in this article we\u2019ll go over what to do next.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a tax rebate?<\/h3>\n<p>A tax rebate is a refund of any tax that you pay which exceeds what you actually owe. Most of us normally pay tax on taxable income that we earn, but there might be times when we end up overpaying. If this happens, you may be able to claim a rebate to get back the tax you overpaid.  <\/p>\n<h3>Do HMRC automatically refund overpaid tax?<\/h3>\n<p>This depends on whether you\u2019re employed, self-employed, or receive a pension, and what type of income you think you might have overpaid tax on. You\u2019ll normally only receive an automatic tax refund if you\u2019re registered for Self Assessment, but this is not always the case. It&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/am-i-paying-the-right-amount-of-tax-2576.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check you&#8217;re paying the right amount of tax<\/a>!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What happens if I pay too much tax on employed income?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re employed or receive a pension and pay too much tax by the end of the tax year, HMRC will send a tax calculation letter (also known as a P800).<\/p>\n<p>Your P800 will usually include the details of your total income for the year, the tax that has been paid, and how much tax you still owe or are due as a refund. The letter will also explain how to get a refund for your overpaid tax.<\/p>\n<h4>What should I do if I don\u2019t receive a tax calculation letter?<\/h4>\n<p>The letters are normally sent out between June and November, but if you don\u2019t receive one and think you have paid too much tax, you might still be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/claim-tax-refund\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim a tax refund online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/what-happens-if-an-employer-makes-a-mistake-with-paye-46670.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">your employer has deducted too much income tax from you<\/a>, you might also need them to contact HMRC to confirm the correct amount. There are a few reasons that this can happen, such as if you:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Have more than one job<\/li>\n<li>Are placed on the wrong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/income-tax\/what-is-a-tax-code-14789.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax code<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Start a new job <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/can-i-take-on-an-employee-without-a-p45-56533.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and don\u2019t have a P45<\/a>. Your new employer will normally ask you to complete a New Starter checklist, but might also place you on an emergency tax code<\/li>\n<li>Retire from employment during the year, before starting to receive a pension<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Check your payslips carefully, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/what-is-a-p60-for-3738.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">or your P60<\/a> which shows all of the tax paid in a tax year. You can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/why-you-should-check-your-personal-tax-account-today-25890.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check your Personal Tax Account<\/a> to see what tax information HMRC have for you.<\/p>\n<p>Any overpayments are normally adjusted at the end of the year or corrected through the following year\u2019s tax code, but if you leave work before that can happen then you may be able to request a tax refund. <\/p>\n<h4>What if I start working elsewhere?<\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019ll only need to claim if you are out of work for more than 4 weeks and have not returned to work. <\/p>\n<h4>How can I claim back income tax if I leave work?<\/h4>\n<p>If you stop working in the middle of a tax year, for instance because you\u2019ve been made redundant, retire, or decide to return to full-time education, you might be able to claim back some of the tax that you paid while you were working, as long as you:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Have had your final pay from your employer<\/li>\n<li>Are not in receipt of taxable benefits or a pension from your employer<\/li>\n<li>Haven\u2019t started a new job<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You\u2019ll normally be able to submit your claim online <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/creating-a-government-gateway-account-176371.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">using a Government Gateway account<\/a> (you can set this up fairly easily if you don\u2019t already have one), or you can claim through the post using a P50 form.<\/p>\n<p>HMRC can take up to 14 days to process a claim. Once it has been processed you will either receive a payment by cheque or bank transfer, or HMRC will write to you and explain why the claim has been rejected.<\/p>\n<h3>Can I reclaim tax if I pay too much on self-employed income?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can, but the process for receiving a tax refund is a bit different if you\u2019re registered for Self Assessment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">You won\u2019t receive a P800 tax calculation letter or a Simple Assessment letter if you\u2019re registered for Self Assessment.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re registered for Self Assessment and pay too much tax, HMRC will adjust your tax bill automatically. You\u2019ll be asked to confirm where you would like them to send your overpayment (it\u2019s normally straight to your bank).<\/p>\n<p>This is particularly common for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/cis\/the-construction-industry-scheme-and-subcontractors-2664.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subcontractors who aren\u2019t registered through the Construction Industry Scheme<\/a> and work for a contractor. <\/p>\n<h3>Can I claim a tax refund on savings and investments?<\/h3>\n<p>Your bank or building society will usually apply the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/what-is-the-personal-savings-allowance-58471.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Personal Savings Allowance<\/a> on any interest you earn from savings and investments, and then you\u2019ll pay tax on any interest you earn above it. <\/p>\n<p>If you think that you\u2019ve paid too much tax on savings interest, you can request a refund online, or by using an R40 form (using a separate form for each tax year you\u2019re claiming for). Parents can also use the form on behalf of their children to reclaim tax deductions made on a child\u2019s savings.<\/p>\n<h3>Can I claim back tax if I leave the UK?<\/h3>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-happens-to-my-tax-if-i-leave-the-uk-4145.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leave the UK for a longer period of time<\/a> you might be able to claim tax relief or a refund of any tax that you\u2019ve already paid. Claims can be made online using a Government Gateway account, or through the post using a P85 postal form.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-residence\/why-would-you-complete-a-form-p85-3848.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Claiming A Tax Refund if you Leave the UK<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>How far back can I claim a tax overpayment?<\/h3>\n<p>You can normally claim a tax rebate on overpaid tax four years from the end of the tax year in which the overpayment happened.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re submitting a claim for multiple years, make sure that you don\u2019t backdate it further than you\u2019re allowed! Your claim might be rejected, and you may not be able to reclaim the overpaid tax, even in more recent years.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Tax is a complicated subject, and nobody likes having to pay more than they need to!
