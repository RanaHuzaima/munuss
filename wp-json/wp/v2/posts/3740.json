What products or services will you offer, and how much will you charge?<\/p>\n<p>Do you need premises or equipment? Are there any legal or regulatory requirements to consider, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-write-the-perfect-business-plan-25798.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what will your business plan look like<\/a>? Then of course there&#8217;s tax to pay and customers to find &#8211; and that&#8217;s just to start with!<\/p>\n<p>With more than 4 million people in the UK currently self-employed, it\u2019s certainly a very popular option. If you\u2019re thinking of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/starting-a-new-business\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">starting your own business<\/a>, take a look at our beginners guide to kick you off.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of being self-employed?<\/h3>\n<p>People chose to become self-employed for a huge variety of reasons. From having more control over the work which you take on, to being more flexible with when and where you do it, and beyond to all manner of financial reasons. What you might consider to be a benefit largely depends on what you need to get out of being self-employed.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the disadvantages of being self-employed?<\/h3>\n<p>One big challenge with being self-employed is that you don\u2019t get any of the benefits that employed people get. These include things like sick pay, paid time off, and employer-sponsored pension contributions.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re self-employed you\u2019re also responsible for managing your own taxes, which can be complex and time-consuming, often requiring a good understanding of tax regulations. <\/p>\n<p>Lots of people also find that their earnings aren\u2019t always consistent \u2013 especially when your business is still new. This can make it harder to access some types of financial services, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/getting-a-mortgage-when-self-employed-3779.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">such as mortgages<\/a> and personal loans, because lenders may consider your income to be less stable compared to someone in employment.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/startup-business-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Startup accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only <strike>\u00a354.50<\/strike> \u00a332.70 per month <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How do I become self-employed?<\/h3>\n<p>There are lots of different ways to be self-employed, from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-on-my-hobby-side-business-13671.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">starting an online side-hustle in your spare time<\/a> to setting up a limited company that you work on full-time, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/franchises\/should-i-buy-into-a-franchise-60707.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buying into a franchise<\/a>. One of the first business decisions you\u2019ll make is to choose a structure for your business. <\/p>\n<h3>Choosing a business structure<\/h3>\n<p>Being \u2018self-employed\u2019 simply means that you work for yourself, but this doesn\u2019t actually explain how you operate the business. It\u2019s your business structure that refers to the legal status of your business, and this affects how you set it up, what tax you pay, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/paying-yourself-through-your-business\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how you take money out of the business for yourself<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of options available depending on your needs, so think about things like:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>How financially risky the business is<\/li>\n<li>The income you expect to make<\/li>\n<li>Whether you want to information about your business to be publicly available<\/li>\n<li>Who else is involved in the business<\/li>\n<li>How you plan to fund it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/which-legal-structure-should-i-choose-when-i-start-a-business-14385.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">different business structures and how to choose one<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>What can I call my business?<\/h4>\n<p>This is entirely up to you, as long as the name is available to use and doesn\u2019t give the impression that your business is part of another organisation or affiliated in some way. Some businesses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/what-is-the-difference-between-a-company-name-and-a-trading-name-162426.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use a \u2018trading name\u2019<\/a>, where you register the business under one title but then use a different name to actually carry out work.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you might register the business using your actual name, but use the trading name \u2018Electricians on Demand\u2019 for marketing reasons. <\/p>\n<h4>What do I do next?<\/h4>\n<p>Your next steps partly depend on what business structure you choose, along with other factors such as the industry you work in (for example, if you need a specific type of insurance to be allowed to do this sort of work).<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to have a think about market research. Writing a business plan can also be a useful way to organise your thoughts and make those early decisions (we have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/business-plan-template\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free business plan template<\/a> to help you get started!).<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/how-to-start-a-business-from-scratch-74629.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accountants\u2019 top tips for starting a business<\/a> to learn more.<\/div>\n<h3>What tax do I pay if I\u2019m self-employed?<\/h3>\n<p>Being self-employed means that you\u2019re responsible for reporting and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paying tax on the money you earn from your business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-type-of-tax-return-do-i-need-to-submit-2566.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">type of tax returns you need to submit<\/a> and the tax you must pay partly depends on what sort of business structure you operate, but it\u2019s also affected by other factors such as your turnover, who you work with, and whether you employ anyone. <\/p>\n<p>The table shown below briefly explains what types of tax might affect your business, as well as other deductions you could see as part of your tax calculation.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"30%\"><strong>Type of tax<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What is it?<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Income Tax<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">A tax you pay on any personal income you receive, such as profits from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/soletrader\/how-do-i-become-a-sole-trader-72592.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">being a sole trader<\/a>, money you make from renting out a property, or a salary you take from an employer.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>National Insurance Contributions (NICs)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Self-employed people pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/national-insurance\/for-self-employed-businesses-22965.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Insurance Contributions<\/a> on their personal income.
