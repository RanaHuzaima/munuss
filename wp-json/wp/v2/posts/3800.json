From tradespeople to healthcare workers, builders to children\u2019s entertainers, thousands of people need their own transport to carry out their jobs.<\/p>\n<p>But did you know, you can actually claim some of the running costs and other vehicle expenses against your tax bill? This includes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/vehicles\/claiming-expenses-for-an-electric-or-hybrid-car-39680.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">electric and hybrid vehicles<\/a>. Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3>I&#8217;m self-employed and need a vehicle for work. What are my options?<\/h3>\n<p>So, you\u2019ve decided you need a work vehicle. Depending on a few factors (not least budget), there are several options, including:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Using your own vehicle in your business<\/li>\n<li>Leasing a vehicle<\/li>\n<li>Hiring a vehicle each time you need one<\/li>\n<li>Owning a vehicle as a limited company<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The rules around each of these can vary depending on your business structure, so we\u2019ll go through them in more detail.<\/p>\n<h3>Personal use versus business use<\/h3>\n<p>This question comes up a lot, so we thought it would be worth explaining the terminology. Business use describes any journey you make in your vehicle which relates wholly and exclusively to your business.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">You can only claim tax relief on expenses which relate to business use.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nSome vehicles have \u2018dual usage\u2019 where you sometimes drive the car or van for personal journeys as well as for business reasons. You can only claim the part of your expenses which relate to the business, so you\u2019ll need to separate these. Unfortunately, if you can\u2019t distinguish between the business and private element, you won\u2019t be able to claim any of the expense.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Commuting to your normal place of business does not count as a business expense.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor example, if you drive from your home to the office or workshop you normally operate from, it\u2019s not classed as a journey which you can claim. The same principle of personal use versus business use also applies if you&#8217;re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/can-i-reclaim-vat-on-vehicles-and-fuel-for-my-business-104699.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming the VAT on your fuel costs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Claiming expenses if you use your own vehicle in your business<\/h3>\n<p>You can use your personal vehicle for business purposes and claim tax relief on the cost of doing so. There are two methods of working out your vehicle expenses under this method, although the structure of your business might restrict which option you can use.<\/p>\n<p>Sole traders and individual partners in a business partnership can claim expenses with either method, whereas limited companies can only claim their actual costs:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Calculate the actual cost of using your car or van for work trips<\/li>\n<li>Claim a flat rate for each mile you travel (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/what-are-simplified-expenses-47649.html#simplified-expenses-for-mileage-if-you-use-a-vehicle-for-the-business\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also known as simplified expenses<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Claiming actual costs<\/h4>\n<p>Your \u2018actual expenses\u2019 are what it costs you personally each time you use your own vehicle for business purposes, such as paying for fuel, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. This method can be useful if your vehicle is particularly expensive to run, or if claiming a flat rate per mile would leave you out of pocket.<\/p>\n<p>It does require a fair amount of extra admin though. You\u2019ll need to log the details of every expense relating to your vehicle, such as invoices and receipts, as well as keeping a record of each business trip.<\/p>\n<p>The amount you can claim is worked out based on the total amount of business miles you travel as a proportion of your total mileage. For example, if 40% of the miles you travel in a year relate to business, you can claim 40% of your total costs.<\/p>\n<h5>Can be claimed by<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Limited companies<\/li>\n<li>Sole traders<\/li>\n<li>Partners in a partnership<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Claiming flat rate expenses <\/h4>\n<p>The other option is to claim a flat rate for each business mile you travel using your vehicle. This method is easier to work out, although it&#8217;s useful to check if this covers the true cost &#8211; especially if it&#8217;s expensive to run! The rate you can claim per mile is shown in the table below.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"50%\"><strong>Type of Vehicle<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Flat Rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Cars and goods vehicles (up to 10,000 miles)<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">45p per mile<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Cars and goods vehicles (after 10,000 miles)<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">25p per mile<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Motorcycles<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">24p per mile<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h5>Can be claimed by<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Sole traders<\/li>\n<li>Partners in a partnership<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit different when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/limited-company-expenses-guide-can-claim-6140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming expenses in limited companies<\/a> because you can\u2019t claim using simplified expenses. If you use your own vehicle for a business trip, your company will reimburse your expenses, and then claim tax relief on this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">when it submits a Company Tax Return<\/a>. The payment you receive from your company will be worked out using HMRC\u2019s flat rate per each mile of travel.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Leasing a vehicle for business<\/h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/leasing-a-car-personally-versus-through-your-limited-company-101194.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lease a vehicle specifically for your business<\/a>, either personally or through your own limited company. Leasing a car or other vehicle does have its advantages, because you\u2019ll only pay for the period that you use it, rather than the whole vehicle. Making monthly payments can also help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">manage your cash flow<\/a>, rather than making a larger up-front payment. <\/p>\n<p>The downside is that you don\u2019t actually own the asset, so you can\u2019t sell it on if you need to, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/the-beginners-guide-to-capital-allowances-127149.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim capital allowances<\/a> (which we\u2019ll get to in the section about buying a vehicle!).<\/p>\n<h4>Leasing a car if you operate as a sole trader or partner<\/h4>\n<p>Sole traders can lease a vehicle for business use, but if you also drive it for personal (non-business) journeys, then you\u2019ll need to work out the proportion of use. For example, if 40% of your mileage relates to business use, you can claim 40% of the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The next bit of working out your claim relates to vehicle\u2019s emissions. According to HMRC \u201cif you leased a car on or after 6 April 2020 and the CO2 emissions are more than 110g\/km, you must disallow 15% of the hire charge or rental cost.\u201d Basically, your claim is based on emissions, so electric and hybrid vehicles could work out to be more cost efficient!  <\/p>\n<p>Work out your claim as if all of the mileage was for the business, and then subtract the proportion which relates to personal use. <\/p>\n<h4>Leasing a car if you operate a limited company<\/h4>\n<p>Leasing a car through a limited company means that it\u2019s the company which owns the responsibility, so there\u2019s less risk for you personally, but it also means that if you drive the vehicle for personal travel then it may be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">treated as a Benefit in Kind<\/a>. This means you&#8217;ll pay tax on the value of the benefit, but the company can claim expenses associated with the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>The other option is to lease it personally, and then charge business mileage to your company so it can reimburse you based on the flat rate per mile of travel.<\/p>\n<h3>Hiring a vehicle<\/h3>\n<p>If you only need a vehicle for occasional business use, you may decide to hire one whenever you need it for a specific business journey. You can then claim the cost of hiring the vehicle as a business expense.<\/p>\n<h3>Owning a vehicle in a limited company<\/h3>\n<p>This bit gets it own section because limited companies are a separate legal entity to the people in them, so any assets it owns belong to the business, rather than you as a shareholder or director.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a really important distinction because the vehicle can only be used for business purposes. If any personal travel does take place, then it\u2019s likely to be classed as a Benefit in Kind, so you\u2019ll pay tax on value of the benefit that you receive.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, the company can claim for any expenses the vehicle incurs. Owning an asset through your limited company also means the business can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-depreciation-182315.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the vehicle\u2019s depreciation<\/a> to claim tax relief against its bill for Corporation Tax. Known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/different-types-of-capital-allowances-127089.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">capital allowances<\/a>, this area of the tax rules is particularly confusing, so do have a chat with your accountant about it!<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t risk getting it wrong!<\/h3>\n<p>HMRC may ask for evidence to support your claim for vehicle expenses, so make sure your records are accurate and well-organised. Keep all your receipts and records for at least six years after the end of the relevant tax year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
