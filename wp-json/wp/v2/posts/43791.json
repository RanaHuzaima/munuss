Workplace culture holds a lot of clout because people want to spend their working hours in an environment where they feel valued. But getting it right can be tricky, especially if you\u2019re just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/new-employers-guide\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking your first steps towards becoming a new employer<\/a>. <\/p>\n<h3>Why is being a good employer important?<\/h3>\n<p>The fact is that when employers prioritise the wellbeing and satisfaction of their employees, it creates a sense of loyalty and commitment throughout the workforce. A supportive, happy workplace not only boosts employee morale but also contributes to increased productivity and creativity.<\/p>\n<p>Good employers understand the unique strengths and needs of their team members, promoting a culture of collaboration and growth. Additionally, a positive employer-employee relationship often results in lower staff turnover rates, saving both time and money.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Being a good employer is more than a moral obligation; it&#8217;s an investment in the long-term success of the business.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nRemember, it\u2019s an ongoing process of learning and adapting. Want to know how it\u2019s done? Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3>Communicate effectively<\/h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Keep open and transparent communication with your employees:<\/strong> Issues tend to fester if staff don\u2019t feel listened to, or like they can\u2019t voice their worries or concerns effectively.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make sure staff feel heard and valued:<\/strong> Set clear expectations regarding roles, responsibilities, and goals. This can help avoid misunderstandings and promotes accountability too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Acknowledge and appreciate hard work:<\/strong> Recognition boosts morale and encourages a positive work environment. We all like to hear a few kind words sometimes!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s just as important to communicate bad news as it is to share the good stuff. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/how-do-i-make-someone-redundant-in-my-small-business-3776.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you need to consider staff redundancies<\/a> then it may be better to explain what&#8217;s happening rather than leaving staff to speculate.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/outsourced-payroll-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Complete managed payroll service<\/h3>\n<p>From just \u00a312.00 per payslip<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Provide professional development and feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Constructive feedback also helps employees grow. Regularly check in on performance and offer guidance on improvement. Support your employees&#8217; career growth by providing opportunities for training and development too. This not only benefits them but also enhances their contribution to your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Offer fair pay and perks<\/h3>\n<p>You will need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/paye\/understanding-accountancy-terms-pay-as-you-earn-paye-47074.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) as soon as you employ your first member of staff<\/a>, but make sure your employees are fairly compensated for their skills and contributions too. <\/p>\n<p>This can vary a bit between geographical area and will also depend on the job market for that role, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/how-much-should-i-pay-an-employee-13690.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fair pay is crucial for motivation and job satisfaction<\/a>. Do your research into the realistic pay levels you need to offer. <\/p>\n<p>When it comes to attracting the best people for the job, you might also want to consider staff perks <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and other Benefits in Kind<\/a>. This could be things like private healthcare or gym membership for example. You should also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/can-i-afford-to-give-my-employee-a-pay-rise-60725.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consider offering regular pay rises<\/a> if you can possibly afford to.<\/p>\n<p>There are also all sorts of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/what-are-the-non-taxable-benefits-for-employees-3876.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">non-taxable perks and benefits which you can offer to your employees<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\/salary-calculator\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online salary calculator<\/a> to work out the cost of hiring someone.<\/div>\n<h3>Know about pensions and auto-enrolment<\/h3>\n<p>Automatic enrolment has been gradually introduced in stages since 2012. It basically means that eligible employees must be automatically enrolled in a company pension scheme to help them save for retirement.<\/p>\n<p>Unless your employee chooses to opt out of the scheme, you must make a minimum contribution towards their pension of 3% each time you pay them, and the total contributions from both you and your employee must be a minimum of 8%. Some businesses decide to pay a higher rate to add further value and attract staff.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/pensions-and-auto-enrolment-for-employers-108505.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pensions and Auto Enrolment for Employers<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>Understand parental leave and pay<\/h3>\n<p>Your employees may be entitled to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employers-guide-to-parental-leave-14334.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a minimum amount of statutory leave and pay for any absences relating to their children<\/a>. Entitlements can vary depending on the nature of the absence, and how long they&#8217;ve been working for you, so it&#8217;s good to make sure both you and your team know what&#8217;s what. You might also decide to offer additional discretionary pay or leave alongside the statutory minimums.<\/p>\n<h3>Make sure employees have a good work-life balance<\/h3>\n<p>Maintaining a good work-life balance is crucial for employees as it directly impacts their overall well-being and performance. <\/p>\n<p>When staff have the opportunity to balance professional responsibilities and personal life, they\u2019re less likely to feel stressed, will have increased job satisfaction, and enjoy improved physical and mental health. A balanced lifestyle:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Fosters higher levels of productivity and creativity at work<\/li>\n<li>Allows for meaningful connections with family and friends<\/li>\n<li>Contributes to a more fulfilling and enriched existence<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ultimately, a healthy work-life balance is the cornerstone for sustained career success and a happier, more contented life. It can also avoid physical and mental burnout.<\/p>\n<h3>Offer flexibility<\/h3>\n<p>This one follows on from the idea of a decent work-life balance. Since the pandemic, more and more of us have been working from home &#8211; at least some of the time. Don\u2019t let your best talent walk out the door! Whenever possible, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/flexible-working-for-employers-5132.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">be flexible with work hours and arrangements<\/a>. Whilst many people are now back in the office full time, a new remote or hybrid working culture has grown significantly. <\/p>\n<p>If you can strike a balance that works for everyone as well as the needs of the business, this can really improve job satisfaction and attract a much more diverse range of talent. It could also reduce staff turnover.<\/p>\n<h3>Nurture health and wellbeing<\/h3>\n<p>Prioritise the health and well-being of your employees with a safe working environment and by offering various health benefits. This could be access to a confidential counselling service for example, or regular team away days.<\/p>\n<h3>Get employees involved<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone wants to feel accepted, valued and part of a team. Involve your employees in decision-making processes whenever you can. This fosters a sense of ownership and commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Encourage diversity and a feeling of belonging among your employees too. Demonstrate the values and work ethic you expect from your employees and lead by example.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
