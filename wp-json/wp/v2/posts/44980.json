We explain the different methods of working out your expenses if you work from home, and how to claim them back against your tax bill.<\/p>\n<h3>What counts as a working from home expense?<\/h3>\n<p>Working from home can be a cost-effective and convenient option for lots of self-employed people, removing the need to pay for additional premises (or travel to them!). You\u2019ll normally be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html#can-you-claim-business-expenses-when-working-from-home\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim the proportion of additional household expenses which relate to your business<\/a>, such as:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The cost of lighting and heating in your work area<\/li>\n<li>Repairs which are necessary for your business operations. You\u2019ll need to work out the proportion which applies to your business if you make repairs to the entire property.<\/li>\n<li>Utilities<\/li>\n<li>Internet and phone access<\/li>\n<li>Council Tax<\/li>\n<li>Rent, or the interest charged on your mortgage repayments (but not the actual capital repayment amount)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Working from home expenses for limited companies<\/h4>\n<p>Claiming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/working-from-home\/working-from-home-expenses-for-limited-companies-238347.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expenses if you run a limited company from home<\/a> is a bit confusing because some rules around what you can claim for are different. Operating as a sole trader means that you <em>are<\/em> your business, but a limited company is a separate legal entity to you as the director \u2013 so you\u2019re treated as an employee. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an important point because employees aren\u2019t allowed to claim tax relief on \u2018fixed costs\u2019. These are things that you would pay whether you ran your business at home or not, such as rent, Council Tax, or interest on your mortgage repayments.<\/p>\n<p>There are other considerations too, such as whether or not your internet connection is billed to your company\u2019s name or your own if you also use it personally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which would be considered a benefit and subject to tax<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a complex area, so have a chat with your accountant if you need help.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How do I calculate expenses for working from home?<\/h3>\n<p>There are two methods of working out your expenses claim if you\u2019re a sole trader and use your home for self-employed work:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Claim simplified expenses using HMRC\u2019s flat rate (but only if you work 25 hours or more from home each month)<\/li>\n<li>Work out the actual costs which relate to your business and claim tax relief on those<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the number of hours you work from home means you\u2019re eligible for either method, then it\u2019s entirely up to you which one you use. It\u2019s well worth working out your expenses with both methods, and choosing the one most suitable for your business!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that you can choose to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim the trading allowance rather than tax relief<\/a> on your expenses so again, pick the one which is most beneficial.<\/p>\n<h3>Claiming using simplified expenses<\/h3>\n<p>Simplified expenses are a way of claiming tax relief using flat rates set by HMRC. The amount that you can claim as a sole trader or a partner in a partnership is based on how many hours you spend working from home each month.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"50%\"><strong>Hours worked from home per month<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Amount to claim per month<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">25 \u2013 50<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a310<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">51 \u2013 100<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a318<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">101 or more<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a326<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nUsing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/what-are-simplified-expenses-47649.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the flat-rate method to claim simplified expenses<\/a> means you won\u2019t need to calculate what proportion of your bills relate to your business, but the flat rate offered by HMRC might not be enough to cover all your costs.<\/p>\n<h4>What if you work varying hours each month?<\/h4>\n<p>Running your own business can be unpredictable, so there might be months where you work more hours than others. The simplified method is worked out on a monthly basis, so you\u2019ll be able to claim the amount of tax relief for the number of hours you worked that month.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>For example<\/h4>\n<p>You work 40 hours per month for 3 months, and then 150 hours per month for the remainder of the year. You\u2019ll be able to claim:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>3 months at \u00a310 per month<\/li>\n<li>9 months at \u00a326 per month<\/li>\n<li>For a total of \u00a3264<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Claiming a proportion of your costs<\/h3>\n<p>If you decide not to use the simplified method, or if you\u2019re not eligible to use it because you work fewer than 25 hours at home each month, then you can calculate your expenses on a proportional basis \u2013 known as the costs method.<\/p>\n<p>Not every self-employed person is office based, so this method looks at how much of the property is used for work, and how much time it is used for.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a self-employed plasterer spends most of their working time in other people\u2019s houses, rather than working in their own. A graphic designer will spend more time at home.<\/p>\n<h4>How to calculate expenses using the costs method<\/h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Count the number of rooms in your property<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Assess what percentage of time each room is used for work instead of normal domestic usage. A home office might be used for work 90% of the time, and 10% for personal use. A kitchen might never be used for work, and a dining area might be used on a 60\/40 split<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Calculate your total household running costs for the year<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Divide your total household running costs by the number of rooms in the property, to give you a cost per room<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step 5:<\/strong> Multiply the cost per room by the percentage you use it for work<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step 6:<\/strong> The total business use figures will show you what you can claim as an expense for working from home<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step 7:<\/strong> Reassess this each time you complete a tax return!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What counts as a room?<\/h4>\n<p>According to HMRC a room is a \u201cnormal living space\u201d, so leave out any bathrooms, hallways, or the porch. If you run your business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/can-my-business-pay-for-my-garden-office-240101.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">from a garden office or another structure<\/a> which is billed separately to the rest of your house, you can just treat it as one single room. If it\u2019s included in the bills for the rest of your home, you should count it as another room.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
