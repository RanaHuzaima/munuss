Disposal of an asset usually means it\u2019s been sold, but it can also mean giving it away, swapping it for something else, or receiving compensation for its loss.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Capital Gains Tax normally only applies to individuals, or business structure where there\u2019s no legal distinction between you and your business.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor instance sole traders or someone in a partnership can be liable for Capital Gains Tax because they&#8217;re not legally &#8216;separate&#8217; from the business they run. <\/p>\n<p>An incorporated business (such as a limited company) will pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corporation Tax on any profit it makes<\/a> from disposing of a business asset instead.<\/p>\n<p>Capital Gains Tax can get a bit complicated, so in this post we\u2019ll take you through the basics and give you some simple scenarios to show you how it works.<\/p>\n<h3>Capital Gains Tax for individuals<\/h3>\n<p>Most of us won&#8217;t need to think about Capital Gains Tax that often, but if you dispose of a valuable asset it might cross your radar. The most frequent questions around Capital Gains Tax relate to houses and cars but you might also encounter it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/currency\/beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-and-tax-180067.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you dabble in cryptocurrency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Will I need to pay Capital Gains Tax when I sell my house?<\/h4>\n<p>Property prices have risen rather dramatically over the years, so the sale of your house might mean a very substantial gain indeed. The good news is that you won&#8217;t normally need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/a-guide-to-capital-gains-tax-on-property-134835.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pay Capital Gains Tax on property<\/a> as long as:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>It&#8217;s your only home, which you\u2019ve lived in as your main residence for all the time you\u2019ve owned it<\/li>\n<li>You haven\u2019t let part of it out (not including having a lodger)<\/li>\n<li>You haven&#8217;t used part of your home exclusively for business purposes (using a room as a temporary or occasional office does not count)<\/li>\n<li>The grounds, including all buildings, are less than 5,000 square metres (just over an acre) in total<\/li>\n<li>You didn\u2019t buy it with the aim of making a gain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Do I need to pay Capital Gains Tax if I sell my car?<\/h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re lucky enough to make money on the sale of your car, then you won\u2019t pay Capital Gains Tax on this <strong>as long as it has not been used for business purposes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This goes for classic cars too. So, if you have an E-type sitting in the garage, you can decide to sell it and release the massive gain it has made over the last few years, without getting clobbered by tax.<\/p>\n<h4>What assets are exempt from Capital Gains Tax?<\/h4>\n<p>The key here is what the asset was used for, and how much you get when you dispose of it. Any profit on selling your car is exempt from Capital Gains Tax as long as the car wasn\u2019t used for business. Your main home that you own is usually exempt too, as are:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Gifts to a registered charity<\/li>\n<li>Gifts to a spouse or civil partner<\/li>\n<li>Investments in PEPs or ISAs<\/li>\n<li>UK government gilts and Premium Bonds<\/li>\n<li>Competition, betting, lottery, or pools winnings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Do be aware though that just giving away something (unless it is to your spouse or a charity) will be treated exactly like selling it, and you\u2019ll need to declare the value at the time of sale.<\/p>\n<p>Sensible tax planning is perfectly acceptable, but we\u2019d never advise people to try and pull the wool over HMRC\u2019s eyes. They have seen it all before!<\/p>\n<h3>Capital Gains Tax for businesses<\/h3>\n<p>If your business is a limited company, then it won\u2019t pay Capital Gains Tax. Instead, any gains are taxed as Corporation Tax. <strong>It\u2019s a bit different if you operate as a sole trader or partnership though.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Because there\u2019s no legal distinction between you and your business, any gains the business makes are considered \u2018yours\u2019 so you\u2019ll need to include these gains as part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/understanding-self-assessment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Self Assessment tax return<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst a sole trader will be responsible for all of the gain they make, partners will only need to work out their share of each gain or loss according to their share in the partnership. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth asking for advice if you&#8217;re not sure, because Capital Gains Tax is a complex area for businesses. For example, a business set up to invest in fine art will pay tax differently to a business that just happens to have made a gain on some art it had on the office wall.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Different type of assets in a business<\/h4>\n<p>When we talk about Capital Gains Tax for businesses, then it\u2019s important to understand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-are-business-assets-86076.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what the term asset means within a business context<\/a>. A business might have two different types of asset that it uses.<\/p>\n<h5>Current assets<\/h5>\n<p>The first category refers to assets you use for trading and includes things like stock you sell to customers, raw materials to create products, or working capital.<\/p>\n<p>In accounting terms, these are seen as things which will be used up within the next 12 months, so although they are assets, they are short-term in nature.<\/p>\n<p>From a taxation point of view, these short-term assets form part of the trading of the business. If the business makes a profit when it comes to sell them, then it will pay tax in the normal way.<\/p>\n<h5>Fixed assets<\/h5>\n<p>The second category are long-term assets. In other words, things which are likely to be around for more than a year, and it is this category that is liable to Capital Gains Tax.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s useful to remember that a gain doesn\u2019t have to be made on a physical thing. Capital Gains Tax can also be payable on intangible items like brands, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/protecting-your-business-name-intellectual-property-and-trademarks-53379.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trademarks and patents<\/a>. <\/p>\n<h3>Working out your gain for Capital Gains Tax<\/h3>\n<p>Capital Gains Tax is worked out based on the profit you make, rather than on the full amount of the sale. In plain terms, it\u2019s the difference between what the asset was worth when you acquired it, and what you sold it for.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">You can also deduct eligible costs relating to the gain you made, and then pay Capital Gains Tax on the amount left over.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor example, if you paid advertising fees to sell the asset, or you spent money to improve the asset beyond normal repairs, you can deduct these costs from the gain you make. Working out the value gets a bit more complicated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/wasting-assets-chattels-and-capital-gains-tax-121684.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you dispose of assets known as a &#8216;chattel set&#8217;<\/a>, where similar items can be combined to form a set &#8211; such as individual pieces in a chess set. <\/p>\n<h4>Is there a tax-free allowance for Capital Gains Tax?<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, and there is a tax-free allowance available before you start paying Capital Gains Tax. Known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#capital-gains-tax-cgt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Annual Exempt Amount<\/a>, the allowance you&#8217;re entitled to depends on whether you&#8217;re an individual or a trustee.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"50%\"><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>2023\/24<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-greyheader\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>2024\/25<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Individuals<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a36,000<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a33,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Trustees<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a33,000<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a31,500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nSo, if you\u2019re an individual and the total of all gains is less than \u00a33,000 in 2024\/25, then you won\u2019t pay any Capital Gains Tax at all. <\/p>\n<p>If all your gains for the year total \u00a310,000 you\u2019ll only pay Capital Gains Tax on the portion of the gain which is over the allowance (in this example, \u00a37,000 is taxable). And never forget! We\u2019re looking at the gain here, and not the sale price.<\/p>\n<h5>Do I need to report capital gains below the allowance?<\/h5>\n<p>No, you only need to report and pay Capital Gains Tax on taxable gains above the allowance.<\/p>\n<h4>Capital Gains Tax relief for businesses<\/h4>\n<p>There are CGT relief schemes available, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/what-is-business-asset-disposal-relief-badr-and-can-i-use-it-92397.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Business Asset Disposal Relief<\/a>, if you need to pay Capital Gains Tax on gains you make through your business.
