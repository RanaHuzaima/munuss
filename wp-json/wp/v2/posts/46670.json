The process of PAYE reporting relies on employers to deduct and report these figures correctly. If an employer deducts the wrong amount of tax or National Insurance, or if they report incorrect information to HMRC, it can cause problems.<\/p>\n<h3>What happens if my employer uses the wrong tax code?<\/h3>\n<p>Not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/income-tax\/what-is-a-tax-code-14789.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">using the right tax code<\/a> inevitably leads to errors in PAYE deductions which can, in turn, result in overpaid or underpaid tax.<\/p>\n<p>HMRC tend to approach the employee directly to collect any underpaid tax though, which can be an unpleasant surprise when the P800 notification letter drops through the letterbox. <\/p>\n<p>If the underpayment is as a result of the employer&#8217;s error, it\u2019s their problem to fix (even if they\u2019re a bit reluctant to acknowledge this).<\/p>\n<p>You can ask your employer to review their records, or HMRC can ask to check them so they can identify the source of the mistake. Even if the error is caused by your employer, HMRC will still expect you to pay the tax that is owed &#8211; though it may be possible to arrange time to pay.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/who-pays-the-bill-if-hmrc-make-a-mistake-105572.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">double-checking that it&#8217;s not HMRC&#8217;s mistake<\/a> &#8211; that also happens!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Does everyone get a P800?<\/h3>\n<p>Not everybody receives a P800 \u2013 the name given to the tax calculation which shows your taxable income and tax paid.
