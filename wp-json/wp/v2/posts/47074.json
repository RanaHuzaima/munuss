Other deductions, such as pension contributions or student loan repayments, can also be processed through payroll.<\/p>\n<h3>Why was PAYE introduced?<\/h3>\n<p>PAYE stands for Pay As You Earn, and the system means employees can pay tax and National Insurance on their wages in instalments, rather than getting a scary looking tax bill at the end of each year. The instalments are calculated based on what an employee is expected to earn during a tax year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking into consideration their personal allowance<\/a>. <\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to register for PAYE?<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to register for PAYE and be issued your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-is-a-tax-reference-number-14791.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">employer reference number<\/a> (also known as a PAYE number) if you have any employees paid \u00a3123 a week or more, even if you\u2019re the only employee (for instance, because you\u2019re a director in your own limited company). <\/p>\n<p>Some contractors also need to register for PAYE so they can become CIS registered \u2013 usually because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/cis\/the-construction-industry-scheme-and-contractors-2669.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">they\u2019re using subcontractors for construction work<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>When should I register as an employer?<\/h3>\n<p>Make sure you register as an employer for PAYE before the first payday. You can\u2019t register more than 2 months beforehand, but keep in mind that it can take up to 15 working days for your PAYE reference number to come through. This is sometimes also called an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/where-is-my-employer-reference-number-181516.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employer Reference Number<\/a>.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/outsourced-payroll-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Complete managed payroll service<\/h3>\n<p>From just \u00a312.00 per payslip<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What are my reporting responsibilities as an employer?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s your responsibility to tell HMRC about the people you employ and how much you pay them, as well as the details of any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/employers-guide-to-statutory-sick-pay-3857.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statutory payments such as sick pay<\/a>.
