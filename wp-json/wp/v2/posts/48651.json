The cost of employing someone includes more than just their salary, so other factors might be: <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Employer pension contributions<\/li>\n<li>Possible sick pay, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/employers-guide-to-statutory-sick-pay-3857.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)<\/a>, and staff cover<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employment-allowance-and-employers-national-insurance-contributions-67362.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employer\u2019s National Insurance contributions<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employers-guide-to-parental-leave-14334.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Parental pay and appropriate cover for leave<\/a>, such as maternity or paternity leave<\/li>\n<li>Holiday pay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also useful to think about any extra kit you might need, such as computer and desk equipment, tools and machinery, and even training costs. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\/salary-calculator\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free online tax calculator<\/a> to work out how much it costs to employ someone.<\/div>\n<h4>Can I afford <em>not<\/em> to employ someone?<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re at maximum capacity and in danger of missing out on terrific opportunities for business growth, it might be time to recruit a helping hand or additional skills and experience. <\/p>\n<h4>Would it be better to outsource?<\/h4>\n<p>There\u2019s always a moment of worry about whether hiring new staff is the right decision. If you can\u2019t justify taking on an employee, you might consider outsourcing to an external agency or freelancer. <\/p>\n<h4>Do you have the physical space to expand?<\/h4>\n<p>Additional staff take up additional space \u2013 but cramped spaces can actually diminish productivity and aren\u2019t that great for morale either.\u202fThis might mean you hire remote or hybrid workers to share the space, or simply need to look at a larger workplace. <\/p>\n<h3>How do I recruit someone?<\/h3>\n<p>Although there isn\u2019t a set legal process for hiring someone, it\u2019s your responsibility as an employer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acas.org.uk\/hiring-someone\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ensure your recruitment process is fair and avoids discrimination<\/a>. You can advertise the role yourself or through a recruitment agency, but it\u2019s essential the advert avoids any potentially discriminatory language. <\/p>\n<p>It can be helpful to prepare a recruitment policy so that your process for reviewing, selecting, and interviewing candidates is applied consistently.  <\/p>\n<h3>Should I carry out applicant checks?<\/h3>\n<p>Once you select who to hire, you\u2019ll need to check that they\u2019re allowed to work for you before you can employ them. <\/p>\n<p>The first step is to check the applicant has the\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/check-job-applicant-right-to-work?step-by-step-nav=47bcdf4c-9df9-48ff-b1ad-2381ca819464\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">right to work\u202fin the United Kingdom<\/a> with you as their employer.
