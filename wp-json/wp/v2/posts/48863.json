My responsibilities are to ensure that we are filing accurate accounts and returns for clients whilst helping them be as tax efficient as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>The day always starts with a cup of tea! Then I will spend a couple of hours working through my emails, answering client queries and carrying out any ad-hoc work. I will spend some time on the phone speaking with new and existing clients.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the day is then spent working on accounts, tax returns and VAT returns with any impending deadlines taking priority.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Getting my 4 year old son up, ready and into school, as well as myself into work before 9am is quite a challenge! Work wise, we have a very diverse client base here at TAP so at times there can be some very technical issues that I have not come across before, which can sometimes require extensive research.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>A lot of our clients are new to business so it can be difficult to understand the tax and VAT systems. Particularly when moving from being employed to working through their own limited company.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I carry out continuous professional development (CPD) so that my knowledge is up to date and I just try to explain as best I can.<\/p>\n<p>I try to reassure clients that we are here to worry about the accounts and tax side of things while they can concentrate on what they know best, which is whatever their chosen business is.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>All of it really! I actually wanted to be an accountant from the age of 13\/14 so I do really enjoy what I do.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>The people here are fab, I have made some great friends. And we are really looked after by the Managing Director and the Manager \u2013 we are treated to lunch twice a week and quarterly staff nights out! It is a great place to work.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Mathematics and problem solving are the most useful\u2026 and being able to use a calculator can come in handy!<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>Nandos! Although you are likely to find me in a children\u2019s play area with my son!<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>Having my son.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Sassy and social, although some colleagues may describe me as demanding, I just see that as a girl knowing what she wants!<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>Prison Break! I made the mistake of watching episode one and now I am hooked\u2026..again!<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>My mum and dad \u2013 they are the best parents and grandparents I could ask for.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>If you could have a dinner party with any three people in the world who would they be? Pink, Dwayne Johnson, and James Cordon.<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
