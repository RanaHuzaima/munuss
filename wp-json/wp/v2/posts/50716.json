And to your bookkeeper, payroll clerk, and any of our admin team, too.<\/p>\n<p>As self-isolation and social distancing measures were introduced, we decided to undertake the mammoth task of adapting our IT infrastructure so that our teams could work safely from home, with no risk to their health.<\/p>\n<p>Staff have taken the IT equipment they use every day at HQ home, so that there is no difference in the level of productivity. Our IT team have worked around the clock to make sure everyone can access the systems and information they need to provide you with a high level of uninterrupted service.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also given every member of staff a headset. It works with their computer equipment, so that you can still make phone calls to any of the team, or have them call you back, just like you normally would.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I still use the same contact details?<\/h3>\n<p>Absolutely \u2013 our phone systems have been adapted so that everyone is still available on the same numbers as usual. If you call us, we&#8217;ll make sure you get to speak to the accountant, bookkeeper or payroll clerk that you usually deal with.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, our email and live chat support are also still running, so we&#8217;re right there if you need us.<\/p>\n<h3>Are all services still available?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, thanks to our staff and IT team working so hard to get everyone set up working from home, all of the usual services that we normally provide to you are running.<\/p>\n<p>This has also provided us with an opportunity to evolve some of our processes so that we can continue an uninterrupted service; for instance, we created dynamic documents so that we can provide you with information on our letterhead if you need it for any reason.<\/p>\n<p>As well as our usual services, we&#8217;re also working hard to make sure we stay up to date with government initiatives, particularly those providing support to businesses and self-employed people dealing with the impact of COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>To keep all of our clients and any potential new clients informed of these changes we&#8217;ve also set up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-support-for-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Support for COVID-19<\/a> information hub.<\/p>\n<h3>Will things take longer without everyone in the same place?<\/h3>\n<p>Our teams are used to working closely in order to provide you with a seamless service. To make sure that this still happens, all staff are now set-up on secure instant messaging software which also facilitates video\/voice calling, so that they can continue to collaborate safely, securely, and in real-time.<\/p>\n<h3>Is my data still safe?<\/h3>\n<p>We take the security of our client&#8217;s data very seriously.<\/p>\n<p>The location where your data is securely stored will not change. Data is never stored on local machines, and especially not outside our premises.<\/p>\n<p>Even though they are now working remotely from home,\u00a0our employees will access the same systems that are normally used during the working day, via a VPN (Virtual Private Network).<\/p>\n<p>Our network and all devices within it are professionally managed and abide by all the expected industry security standards.<\/p>\n<p>Our teams take pride in their work, and are conscientious about making sure that your data remains just that &#8211; your data, and not in the wrong hands.<\/p>\n<h3>I\u2019m not yet a client, but can I still sign up?<\/h3>\n<p>Our support team are also working remotely, and are ready to help you get started. This is a stressful time for business owners and self-employed workers, and we\u2019re doing all we can to help.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Learn more about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">services<\/a> we offer, and ask for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/quotation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">instant online quote<\/a>.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our accountants, bookkeepers, and payroll teams are ready to help you with the same high levels of service.
