This means that you&#8217;re not allowed to simply keep the profits for yourself in the same way that a sole trader can.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, you&#8217;ll need to decide how much to pay yourself. The most tax-efficient way to take an income from your own limited company is normally through a combination of a low salary (in the same way as any other employee) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/dividends-and-taking-a-salary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dividend payments<\/a>. <\/p>\n<h3>Taking a salary and dividends<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a director, you&#8217;re technically an employee of your own limited company.

The Personal Allowance is the amount you are allowed to earn before you have to start paying income tax.

Claiming tax relief on allowable expenses reduces the amount of profit, therefore reducing the amount of Corporation Tax which the company pays.<\/p>\n<p>Salaries are an allowable expense, so if you&#8217;re a company director then paying yourself a salary from the business can help you lower your Corporation Tax bill.<\/p>\n<h4>How does the National Insurance Employment Allowance affect director&#8217;s pay?<\/h4>\n<p>Thanks to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employment-allowance-and-employers-national-insurance-contributions-67362.html#what-is-the-employment-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employment Allowance<\/a>, the optimum salary for a company director also depends on how many other people there are in the business.<\/p>\n<p>In 2024\/25 eligible employers can use the Employment Allowance to claim up to \u00a35,000 in order to cover the costs of employer\u2019s National Insurance.<\/p>\n<p>To be eligible, employers must have at least 1 employee or 2 directors on the payroll, and the directors must not have another company that is claiming the Employment Allowance already.<\/p>\n<p>This means that sole directors can\u2019t claim the allowance, which is why the optimum salary is a bit different for them.<\/p>\n<h3>2024\/25 Director&#8217;s salaries &#8211; How much should I pay myself from my limited company?<\/h3>\n<p>Considering all the taxes and allowances together, the most tax-efficient salary for a limited company director depends on whether you\u2019re a sole director, or there are more people in the business.<\/p>\n<h4>What is the best company salary for sole directors in 2024\/25?<\/h4>\n<p>The most efficient salary for sole directors is a bit more complicated because you can\u2019t claim the Employment Allowance if you\u2019re the only person in the business.<\/p>\n<p>The optimum salary that you take depends on your circumstances, but as a very broad guide you have two options, each with their own considerations. You might pay yourself a director&#8217;s salary of \u00a312,570, or you could go with the lower amount of \u00a39,100. <\/p>\n<h5>Taking a salary of \u00a312,570 (\u00a31,047.50 per month)<\/h5>\n<p>A sole director taking a salary at this level will incur National Insurance on their wages, but this is offset against the tax relief they can claim against Corporation Tax.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>As a sole director you won\u2019t be able to claim the \u00a35,000 Employment Allowance. Taking a salary above the Secondary Threshold like this means that you\u2019ll need to pay Employer NI contributions. It works out at about \u00a3478.86 for the year.<\/li>\n<li>Because this is less than \u00a31,500 of employer\u2019s NI per month, the company could choose to pay its contributions to HMRC on a quarterly basis, even if you receive a monthly salary.<\/li>\n<li>Although the company will incur employer\u2019s NI, it will also be able to claim tax relief for your salary, which will reduce your Corporation Tax bill. This reduction is more than the employer\u2019s NI that your company will need to pay on this salary, so will effectively cancel it out.<\/li>\n<li>This salary is at the Primary Threshold, so you won\u2019t need to pay NI as an employee.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s above the Lower Earnings Limit, so you will still earn NI credits, which is great news for your state pension.<\/li>\n<li>This is at the tax-free Personal Allowance threshold for income tax<\/li>\n<li>Taking a higher salary might affect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">your company\u2019s cash flow throughout the year<\/a> (and will leave a bit less in the pot for dividends)<\/li>\n<li>It might also mean that your accountant or payroll provider charges you a slightly higher fee.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>Take a salary of \u00a39,100 (\u00a3758.33 a month)<\/h5>\n<p>Taking a slightly lower salary as a sole director can mean there&#8217;s more money left for dividends at the end of the year. <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>As a sole director you can\u2019t claim the Employment Allowance, but this salary is at the Secondary Threshold, so your company won\u2019t need to pay employer\u2019s NI on it anyway<\/li>\n<li>This is less than \u00a31,500 of employer\u2019s NI per month, so your company could choose to pay its contributions to HMRC on a quarterly basis, even if you receive a monthly salary.<\/li>\n<li>The company can claim tax relief against your salary, which will help to reduce its Corporation Tax bill<\/li>\n<li>This salary is lower than the Primary Threshold, so you won\u2019t need to pay employee\u2019s NI.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s above the Lower Earnings Limit, so you will still earn NI credits, which is great news for your state pension.<\/li>\n<li>This is less than the tax-free Personal Allowance threshold<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What is the most tax efficient salary for two or more directors in 2024\/25?<\/h4>\n<p>Having at least one employee, or 2 or more directors, on the company payroll means that you\u2019re eligible to claim the Employment Allowance, so you can take a higher salary and still be tax efficient.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The most efficient salary for 2 or more directors in 2024\/25 is <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox-inner\">\u00a312,570<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThis is because two or more directors can take an annual salary up to the Primary Threshold without needing to pay employee&#8217;s National Insurance, and then claim the \u00a35,000 Employment Allowance to cover the portion of employer&#8217;s National Insurance they would otherwise incur.<\/p>\n<h3>What if I have another source of income?<\/h3>\n<p>The optimum amount for director&#8217;s payroll takes advantage of the Personal Allowance (\u00a312,570).
