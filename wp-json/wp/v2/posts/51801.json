The allowance will be deducted from the total amount that you earn in a year, so you&#8217;ll only pay tax on the part of your income that&#8217;s left over. <\/p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re employed <em>and<\/em> self-employed, or receive your income from a variety of sources, you&#8217;ll only be able to use the personal allowance once in a tax year.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you might earn wages from an employer, receive income from property, make money from business activities, or a combination of all of these. The personal allowance will be applied against the total amount, not separately against each source.<\/p>\n<p>You might also be able to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the tax-free trading allowance<\/a> against the first \u00a31,000 of income you make from self-employment.<\/p>\n<h4>How much is the Personal Allowance in 2024\/25?<\/h4>\n<p>The tax-free personal allowance normally increases slightly each year, but the threshold for 2024\/25 (6th April 2024 &#8211; 5th April 2025) will remain frozen at the 2023\/24 level of \u00a312,570.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The tax-free Personal Allowance for 2024\/25 is <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox-inner\">\u00a312,570<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nYou\u2019ll pay income tax on any earnings which are above the \u00a312,570 threshold.

For every \u00a32 that you earn above \u00a3100,000, the Personal Allowance reduces by \u00a31, so your personal tax allowance is zero if you earn \u00a3125,140 or more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Income Tax<\/h2>\n<h4>How do income tax thresholds, rates, and allowances work?<\/h4>\n<p>A tax rate is the percentage of tax payable on money within a particular range, known as a tax band. Income tax in the UK is worked out as a series of marginal bands, so you only pay the relevant tax rate on the part of your income which falls within that tax band.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The amount of tax you pay is worked out as a percentage (known as a tax rate) of your income.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nIt helps to think of the income tax system as a stack of containers. Each container represents a tax band which holds a portion of your salary at a particular level of income. You&#8217;ll pay one rate of tax on the first container of income. If your earnings are more than the first container can hold, you&#8217;ll start filling up the next container, and pay a different rate of tax on the earnings that go into it.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Income tax myth buster<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>Earning more money and moving up into a new tax band <em>doesn&#8217;t<\/em> mean you&#8217;ll pay the new tax rate on <em>all<\/em> of your earnings.

These dividends are a source of income so you&#8217;ll need to pay tax on them. You&#8217;ll normally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/paying-tax-on-dividends-in-2022-23-56115.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay dividend tax<\/a> by submitting a Self Assessment tax return to report any untaxed income you receive.<\/p>\n<p>Dividend tax is payable at a different rate to income tax, so if you&#8217;re a director in your own a limited company you might find it more tax efficient to pay yourself using a combination of dividends and a salary. You&#8217;ll pay income tax on the salary part of your income, and dividend tax on the dividends.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-most-tax-efficient-directors-salary-in-2022_23-51622.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tax efficient salaries for company directors<\/a>.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe income you receive from dividend payments isn&#8217;t subject to National Insurance (so you won&#8217;t pay NI on any dividends). If the total amount of dividend payments you receive in a tax year is more than the personal allowance (or if you&#8217;ve already used it up), you&#8217;ll still be able to claim an additional tax-free dividend allowance. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\/dividend-calculator\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online dividend tax calculator<\/a> will help you work out how much you can expect to pay on dividend income in a tax year.<\/p>\n<h3>Dividend Allowance<\/h3>\n<p>The dividend allowance is the amount you can receive from dividends in a tax year before starting to pay tax on them. Once you go over it, you can deduct the allowance from the total amount of dividends you receive, and pay dividend tax on the amount that&#8217;s left. <\/p>\n<p>The dividend allowance reduced by half in April 2023 and will do so again in April 2024, so you&#8217;ll pay tax on more of your dividend income. The dividend allowance for each year is:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>2023\/24:<\/strong> \u00a31,000<\/li>\n<li><strong>2024\/25:<\/strong> \u00a3500<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Can I claim the dividend allowance as well as the Personal Allowance?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes! The good news is that you can use the dividend allowance as well as your personal tax allowance. For example, in 2024\/25 you could take a salary of \u00a312,570 and a dividend of \u00a3500 without incurring tax or National Insurance.<\/p>\n<h4>How much tax will I pay on dividends?<\/h4>\n<p>The rate of dividend tax you pay is based on what income tax band you&#8217;re in. You can work this out by adding the total amount of dividend income you receive to your other income. Don&#8217;t forget to deduct your personal allowance and dividend allowance!<\/p>\n<h4><em>2023\/24 and 2024\/25 Dividend tax rates<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>The dividend tax rate which is payable on dividends over the allowance is the same in 2023\/24 and 2024\/25.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" width=\"20%\"><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" width=\"25%\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Threshold<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size:0.8rem\">2023\/24<\/b><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" width=\"15%\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Dividend Tax<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size:0.8rem\">2023\/24<\/b><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-greyheader\" width=\"25%\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Threshold<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size:0.8rem\">2024\/25<\/b><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-greyheader\" width=\"15%\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Dividend Tax<\/strong><br \/>\n<b style=\"font-size:0.8rem\">2024\/25<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Personal Allowance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a30 &#8211; \u00a312,570<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">0%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a30 &#8211; \u00a312,570<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Basic rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a312,571 \u2013 \u00a350,270<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">8.75%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a312,571 - \u00a350,270<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">8.75%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Higher rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a350,271 \u2013 \u00a3125,140<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">33.75%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a350,271 - \u00a3125,140<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">33.75%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Additional rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a3125,140 upwards<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">39.35%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a3125,140 upwards<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-grey\" style=\"text-align: center;\">39.35%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200c&nbsp;<br \/>\nOur <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\/limited-company-vs-sole-trader-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free online tax calculator<\/a> will help you compare your take home pay as a sole trader versus as the director of a limited company, so you can work out the most tax-efficient structure for your business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>VAT<\/h2>\n<h4>2024\/25 VAT registration threshold<\/h4>\n<p>The VAT registration and deregistration thresholds increase with effect from 1st April 2024:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Registration threshold:<\/strong> increase from \u00a385,000 to \u00a390,000<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deregistration threshold:<\/strong> increase from \u00a383,000 to \u00a388,000<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The thresholds mean you must <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-do-i-register-for-vat-our-guide-to-vat-registration-93406.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">register your business for VAT<\/a> once its taxable turnover reaches the threshold in any 12 month period, and may request to deregister if your taxable turnover is below \u00a388,000.<\/p>\n<p>For some businesses it can be more tax efficient to register for VAT voluntarily rather than waiting for their turnover to reach the threshold (our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/should-i-voluntarily-register-for-vat-early-14770.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article explains this in a bit more detail<\/a>!)<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/vat-guide-for-small-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VAT Guide<\/a> to learn more about registering, charging for, and reporting VAT.<\/div>\n<h4><em>UK VAT Rates<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-rates-and-thresholds\/how-much-is-vat-in-the-uk-200582.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rate of UK VAT that VAT registered businesses charge<\/a> is based on the type of goods or services being supplied.
