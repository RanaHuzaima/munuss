I like to see what my emails are like before making a cuppa.<\/p>\n<p>I tend to prioritise my emails for the first hour and check any urgent messages, as well as checking any pressing deadlines for filing requirements.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019d probably have to say managing time efficiently, as I like to make sure that every client is getting the best quality service. I prioritise emails in the morning so that people aren\u2019t waiting for help, and then keep on top of them throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p>I love the challenges that the variety of work throws at me. I can be working on the first-year accounts for a sole trader, then a cessation of a limited company, and then assisting with a tax return with capital gains tax. No two days are the same.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>I think right now, the biggest challenge facing most of my clients is the uncertainty of their business during the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis. There\u2019s also the question of what the economy will be like as lockdown begins to relax at some point in the future.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re doing as much as we can to support our clients by responding to individual queries, and have published a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/covid-19-business-support-centre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coronavirus help centre<\/a> on our website too.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019d have to say my biggest skills are my communication and customer service.<\/p>\n<p>I initially came from a retail management background and whilst I have always been a very sociable person, it was here that I was able to hone and develop these skills to their fullest.<\/p>\n<p>They allow me to bridge the knowledge gap with my clients, assisting them with their understanding of accounts and requirements, including filing obligations and deadlines.<\/p>\n<p>I also help put a lot of the smaller businesses at ease, clarifying to them how The Accountancy Partnership works, and what we can do to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assist with their needs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I try to help them with any queries as fully and as clearly as possible, and explain things in layman\u2019s terms so they can comprehend their own responsibilities and obligations. It just helps reduce anxiety and stress for them.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>A few things here for me to say! I love the company I work for, and the team within it. They\u2019re an amazing group of people who all love to come to work, and are all very dedicated to what they do.<\/p>\n<p>The company in turn recognises this, and we are rewarded with fantastic staff nights out and lunches provided from outside caterers. We have recently moved offices, so our surroundings are pretty amazing too.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>On a more personal level, I love having my own client portfolio as it has enabled me to build a strong rapport with a lot of my clients. It\u2019s something I take pride in.<\/p>\n<p>I also love that the company continually offer support and training. I have welcomed this with open arms.<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Organisation and planning, communication and customer service skills. I also like to think I play a small part in creating a pleasant office environment, and have made some amazing friendships here at TAP.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>I love the outdoors and we live in a beautiful part of the country, so are spoilt by beaches and countryside. My favourite places are the beaches.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beautiful and remote part of Hoylake beach where you can walk right out to the shore line. It can often take 40 minutes to reach the sea, and when you look back you see the houses are tiny specks in the distance.<\/p>\n<p>To one side is the view over to New Brighton and beyond, to the other is Hilbre Island with the breath-taking back drop of North Wales. It\u2019s been a haven during this lockdown. A place of undisturbed and unaltered beauty. A great place to switch off from what\u2019s going on right now.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>My proudest achievement has to be having my daughter. She was, and is, a little miracle in our eyes, because we had her through IVF. I\u2019ll always remember the process we went through to become parents, and feel so overwhelmed with pride as I watch her grow. I have an amazing bond with her and love her dearly.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>My colleagues would describe me as very positive, a good friend, great mother, very creative, and very sociable and caring.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I rarely get to read since having my daughter, but on holiday last October I did read \u2018Our House\u2019 by Louise Candlish. Amazing book!<\/p>\n<p>Binge watching&#8230; probably the news right now, just because I\u2019m so ready to hear any slight hint of positivity and a way forwards, so I can see my family and friends again.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>I admire my dad and have often seen him as a mentor to me in life. My dad is very sociable, like me, and has such wise words of encouragement and support. He never judges, only offers guidance should I need it.<\/p>\n<p>He makes me laugh pretty much every time I see him, yet he has a serious side to him that has guided me through my life. I love him and my mum dearly, they are not just my parents they are two of my closest, best friends.<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
