In this article we look at different examples of salary sacrifice schemes, and how to set one up in your workplace.<\/p>\n<h3>How does salary sacrifice work?<\/h3>\n<p>A salary sacrifice scheme basically enables an employee to swap part of their salary in exchange for something else. This means that their take-home pay is lower, so both the employee and you as the employer will pay less income tax and National Insurance, but your employee receives a non-monetary benefit to the same value instead. <\/p>\n<h4>What are some examples of salary sacrifice schemes?<\/h4>\n<p>Some of the most common examples of staff salary sacrifice schemes include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Childcare vouchers:<\/strong> These can be received tax free up to a certain amount each year, and used to pay for registered childcare<\/li>\n<li><strong>Additional pension contributions:<\/strong> Employees make a larger contribution to their pension pot<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cycle-to-work schemes:<\/strong> Where employees sacrifice part of their salary in order to purchase cycling equipment such as a bike and accessories<\/li>\n<li><strong>Work-based training:<\/strong> The employee has their training costs met in exchange for giving up part of their salary<\/li>\n<li><strong>Additional annual leave:<\/strong> Employees &#8216;buy&#8217; additional leave in return for a portion of their salary<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/outsourced-payroll-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Complete managed payroll service<\/h3>\n<p>From just \u00a36.00 per payslip<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>The pros and cons of salary sacrifice<\/h3>\n<p>Like everything in life, there are advantages and disadvantages to salary sacrifice (although this usually depends on your own circumstances).<\/p>\n<p>Receiving a lower salary means employees have less income, so they&#8217;ll pay less tax and National Insurance if the salary sacrifice is eligible. Not all schemes qualify as being tax-free though, so the benefit the employee receives <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">could instead be classed as a Benefit in Kind<\/a> and subject to tax.<\/p>\n<p>Reducing an employee&#8217;s salary amount also reduces the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employment-allowance-and-employers-national-insurance-contributions-67362.html#what-is-employers-national-insurance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Insurance contributions you need to make as their employer<\/a>, though you&#8217;ll still be paying for the equivalent value of the benefit they receive instead.<\/p>\n<h4>It could affect an employee&#8217;s eligibility for some types of statutory pay<\/h4>\n<p>One of the biggest issues is that reducing their take home pay through salary sacrifice can affect an employee&#8217;s eligibility for some types of finance or benefits, such as mortgage applications or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/what-employers-need-to-know-about-statutory-maternity-pay-235025.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Salary sacrifice can also affect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/employers-guide-to-statutory-sick-pay-3857.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)<\/a>, even causing employees to loose their entitlement altogether if their average weekly earnings fall below the threshold to qualify. <\/p>\n<p>If you do decide to offer a salary sacrifice scheme to your employees, it&#8217;s important that you make them aware of the potential risks before they agree to anything.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\/salary-calculator\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online salary calculator<\/a> to work out the cost of hiring someone.<\/div>\n<h3>Do I need to deduct tax for salary sacrifice?<\/h3>\n<p>This depends on what sort of salary sacrifice scheme your employees are involved in. Some schemes are tax free, so you won&#8217;t need to make any deductions for them, such as:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Payment into a pension scheme and\/or pension advice provided by the employer<\/li>\n<li>Workplace nursery services<\/li>\n<li>Childcare vouchers (and those provided directly by the employer before October 2018)<\/li>\n<li>Cycle to work schemes (including bicycles and safety equipment)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit different if the employee receives a non-cash benefit which <em>is<\/em> taxable though, such as a company car or a gym membership. This type of benefit is normally treated as a &#8216;perk&#8217; &#8211; also known as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">benefit in kind<\/a>. Your employee will pay tax (and you&#8217;ll make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employment-allowance-and-employers-national-insurance-contributions-67362.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">employer&#8217;s NI contributions<\/a>) on its equivalent financial value. <\/p>\n<h3>Should salary sacrifice be included in an employee&#8217;s contract?<\/h3>\n<p>Your employee must agree to participate in a salary sacrifice scheme before joining, and the terms of this agreement should be reflected in their employment contract. It&#8217;s also important to ensure that sacrificing part of their salary doesn&#8217;t result in your employee earning less than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#the-national-minimum-wage-nmw-and-national-living-wage-nlw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Minimum Wage<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
