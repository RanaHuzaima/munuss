Fortunately, the incorporation process is actually fairly straightforward once you know what your responsibilities are. <\/p>\n<p>To start you off, we explain the steps involved in incorporating a limited company in the UK, and answer some of your most frequently asked questions.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a limited company?<\/h3>\n<p>A limited company is a type of business which is legally separate to the people who own and run it. This limits the extent to which you can be personally liable for any debts or issues the company faces.<\/p>\n<h4>Why register as a limited company?<\/h4>\n<p>Like all business decisions there are pros and cons to registering as a limited company, depending on your circumstances. <\/p>\n<p>For instance, setting up a company to run your business limits your personal liability, helping to protect any assets you own personally. It can also give you more tax efficient options for choosing how you pay yourself from the business.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-operating-as-a-limited-company-14752.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">potential advantages and disadvantages of running a limited company<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>What type of limited company should I set up?<\/h3>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-the-different-types-of-uk-limited-company-46179.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">different types of company structure to choose from<\/a>, but if you want to register a limited company there are two main choices:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Private limited company (LTDs)<\/li>\n<li>Public limited company (PLCs)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most small businesses and start-ups will form a private limited company because you don\u2019t need to have a minimum amount of share capital. PLCs require a minimum share capital of \u00a350,000, along with two shareholders, two directors and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-secretary-responsibilities-3792.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a company secretary<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We have a separate article which explains <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/the-difference-between-private-and-public-limited-companies-14800.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the differences between public and private limited companies<\/a> in more detail.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/limited-company-formations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company registration service<\/h3>\n<p>We will incorporate your company free of charge!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What can I call my company?<\/h3>\n<p>Choosing a name is an exciting part of starting a new business, but beware \u2013 this can be a frustrating process!<\/p>\n<p>Trying to find a business name that hasn\u2019t already been snapped up by someone else can be very difficult.

The name must:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>End with \u2018Limited\u2019 or \u2018Ltd\u2019 (or the Welsh equivalents \u2018Cyfyngedig\u2019 or \u2018Cyf\u2019)<\/li>\n<li>Be unique, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/limited-company-formation\/choose-company-name\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not use special characters or punctuation<\/a> to create a name which is otherwise similar to one already registered<\/li>\n<li>Not be offensive or use sensitive words or expressions<\/li>\n<li>Not suggest any sort of official accreditation or connection to the government unless you have permission<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you plan on trading overseas at any point, it might also be worth checking that your business name can cross the border without causing any offense in a different language and culture!<\/p>\n<h3>Where should I register my limited company?<\/h3>\n<p>To set up your limited company you\u2019ll need to register it at Companies House. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/limited-company-formation\/register-your-company?step-by-step-nav=37e4c035-b25c-4289-b85c-c6d36d11a763\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">do this yourself online<\/a>, by sending an IN01 form through the post, or by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company-formations\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">using a company formations service such as your accountant<\/a>.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/sxF8btH_beg?si=MiQkjE4Wf1k4l-aH\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h4>Do I need to tell HMRC about my new company?<\/h4>\n<p>Companies House will normally take care of notifying HMRC, so you won\u2019t need to contact them yourself unless you decide to register for Corporation Tax at a later date. Just make sure you register within 3 months of starting to trade!<\/p>\n<h4>Is there a different process for registering a limited company in Scotland?<\/h4>\n<p>The process for registering a limited company in Scotland is the same as it is to register a company in any other part of the UK. Just be aware that:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>If you incorporate a limited company in Scotland, it must have a Scottish address. You can\u2019t use a registered office address in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland.<\/li>\n<li>Your Company Registration Number (CRN) will start with the letters SC, followed by 6 digits<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What information do I need to register a limited company<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to supply Companies House with a few details in order to set up a new company, such as your personal information, and the details of anyone else involved in your business. Companies House will also need to know the location and nature of your company.<\/p>\n<h4>Personal information about yourself<\/h4>\n<p>As well as the usual request for your full name and address, you\u2019ll need to provide more detailed info such as the town you were born in, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/national-insurance\/what-is-national-insurance-3855.html#do-i-need-a-national-insurance-number\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Insurance number<\/a>, and so on.<\/p>\n<h4>Verifying the identity of people in the company<\/h4>\n<p>Companies House have announced plans to introduce a new identity verification system to confirm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/shareholders\/what-is-a-shareholder-of-a-company-3837.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the identity of company shareholders<\/a> and directors. The system is not yet in place so you don&#8217;t need to do anything just yet. <\/p>\n<p>Once the new rules are active, it&#8217;s anticipated that you&#8217;ll need to provide identity documents such as a passport either directly to Companies House, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/authorising-an-agent-to-help-you-with-hmrc-181768.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">via an authorised agent (such as your accountant)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>The nature of business \u2013 SIC code<\/h4>\n<p>Known as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/standard-industrial-classification-of-economic-activities-sic?step-by-step-nav=37e4c035-b25c-4289-b85c-c6d36d11a763\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Industry Classification (SIC) code<\/a>, this describes the nature of your company\u2019s business. For instance, an architect setting up a limited company would most likely use the SIC code 71111 &#8211; Architectural activities.<\/p>\n<h4>Making a statement of lawful purpose<\/h4>\n<p>The &#8216;subscribers&#8217; (the original shareholders of the new limited company) must confirm that the company is being formed for lawful purposes.<\/p>\n<h4>Registered office address<\/h4>\n<p>You must provide an address when you register your company \u2013 you\u2019re not allowed to register without one. If your company has a physical location, you can use this as long as it is a full UK address. <\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to be able to access the location easily (or at least use a service which will manage your post for you), so don\u2019t send it to offices at the other end of the country if you\u2019re not able to get important documents sent on.

You\u2019ll need to provide the names and addresses of each director you appoint.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need at least one director to form a private company, but you&#8217;ll need a minimum of two directors if you&#8217;re setting up a public limited company.

Whereas a director is responsible for running the company, a shareholder is the person who owns it \u2013 literally holding a share.<\/p>\n<h4>Documents which show how you will run your company<\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to prepare:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>A Memorandum of Association (an agreement between the shareholders agreeing to form the company)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-model-articles-of-association-in-a-limited-company-196848.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Articles of Association<\/a> (written rules which explain director\u2019s powers, and what shareholders are entitled to.

You don\u2019t have to be a UK resident in order to set up shop here, but you will need a UK registered address.<\/p>\n<h4>Do I need other directors to form a private limited company?<\/h4>\n<p>The answer to this depends on whether you\u2019re setting up a private limited company or a public one. If you decide to set up a private limited company, you can do it by yourself without other directors (or shareholders). <\/p>\n<p>Setting up a public limited company is a bit different. You\u2019ll need to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/difference-between-director-and-secretary-3796.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a qualified secretary and at least two directors<\/a>, who must all be different people.<\/p>\n<h4>Who can be a limited company director?<\/h4>\n<p>A company director can be an individual, or another corporate entity such as a partnership or even another limited company. <\/p>\n<p>Every company must have at least one director who is a \u2018natural person\u2019. This means they\u2019re a real-life human individual, rather than another corporate entity or organisation. <\/p>\n<p>Directors should also be older than 16, and not be disqualified from being a director, or bankrupt (or in the process of being declared so).  <\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 520px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 520\/1059;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 520px;\" title=\"Can I be a Sole Director?\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Can-I-be-a-Sole-Director-2.svg\" alt=\"Can I be a Sole Director?\" width=\"520\" height=\"1059\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>When should you register as a limited company?<\/h4>\n<p>You might decide to operate as a sole trader before making the move to incorporation, and this is entirely up to you. Some business owners find it more tax efficient to start out this way, and then register the company at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>From a compliance point of view, if you plan to register a limited company then you must do so within 3 months of starting to do business. <\/p>\n<h4>Can I form my limited company myself or should I use an agent?<\/h4>\n<p>You can register your limited company yourself online or using a postal IN01 form, or you can ask a formations agent to complete the incorporation process on your behalf. Your existing solicitor or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company-formations\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accountant might offer a formations service<\/a>, or you can research agencies which offer a standalone service.<\/p>\n<h4>How much does it cost to register a company?<\/h4>\n<p>It costs \u00a312 to register a company online, and you can pay for it using a credit or debit card, or through your PayPal account. Registering by post (which is a requirement if you decide not to use \u2018limited\u2019 in your company name) costs \u00a340, which is payable by cheque. A formations agent might charge you extra to cover the cost of their services.<\/p>\n<h4>How long does it take to register a limited company<\/h4>\n<p>Once you submit your incorporation request the company will usually be registered within 24 hours. It might take a bit longer to receive your registration details, depending on whether you requested online or postal notifications. <\/p>\n<h4>How do I register a limited company as dormant?<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s not unheard of to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dormant-company\/dormant-companies-explained-8202.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register a limited company only to leave it dormant<\/a>, and there are lots of reasons why this might be useful for you. For instance, if you want to protect a brand name or trademark, or you want to use it to hold assets or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/protecting-your-business-name-intellectual-property-and-trademarks-53379.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intellectual property<\/a>.
