That doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t ever face the prospect of salary increases though, so in this article, we\u2019ll look at reasons why you might (or might not) award a pay rise. <\/p>\n<h3>Do I have to give pay rises to staff?<\/h3>\n<p>Unless it\u2019s written in their contract, you\u2019re not actually under any legal obligation to give your employees a pay rise as long as their pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/whats-the-difference-between-the-national-living-wage-and-the-national-minimum-wage-90465.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">meets minimum wage requirements<\/a>.  <\/p>\n<p>As their employer it\u2019s entirely up to you whether or not you\u2019ll consider pay rise requests. That said, it\u2019s certainly worth scheduling in regular reviews \u2013 even if it\u2019s just for your own benefit, to keep an eye on things. <\/p>\n<h3>Should I give my employee a pay increase?<\/h3>\n<p>Like all business decisions, there are good reasons to do, or not do, something. The rationale for agreeing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/how-much-should-i-pay-an-employee-13690.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what to pay someone can change depending on circumstances<\/a>, but increasing someone\u2019s salary usually relates to employee retention, rewards, or growth. For instance: <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>They consistently generate leads or sales, and contribute towards bringing in revenue<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ve given them more responsibility, or they\u2019re performing above their remit<\/li>\n<li>They demonstrate long-standing loyalty and dedication to your business<\/li>\n<li>Your employee shows outstanding potential for the future<\/li>\n<li>Their skills, knowledge, or experience are critical to the success of the business, and add value in a way that would be damaging if they went to a competitor, or would be difficult to replace<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your employee is ticking off any of these, they might well be a keeper! Rewarding deserving staff can be great for a business, improving staff retention, employee satisfaction and morale, and garnering loyalty. It also reduces the resources you need to spend on recruitment.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/outsourced-payroll-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Complete managed payroll service<\/h3>\n<p>From just \u00a312.00 per payslip<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How should I respond to a pay rise request from my employee?<\/h3>\n<p>Having a written policy or process in place that you can refer to will help you take a more logical, impartial approach to considering requests for a pay raise. <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">That said, it\u2019s well worth being flexible, and any request should be considered on its own merit.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nHaving a chat about it will help you understand their motivations. For instance, is a rival firm advertising a similar role for more money, or do they have new responsibilities or qualifications? An in-person chat can sometimes help break down the barriers (but having things in writing is always useful!). <\/p>\n<p>Whatever your response, it\u2019s extremely useful to explain the reasoning behind your decision. For the long-term, put a plan of action in place. Outline targets they need to hit or new skills to acquire in order to level-up. Putting a framework and date on the plan will make it real for both of you. <\/p>\n<h3>What should I consider before awarding a pay rise?<\/h3>\n<p>Whilst you might be thinking \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose them\u201d, can you actually afford to pay them more? As well as paying a higher wage, the employer\u2019s contributions you make on top of their salary will also increase.  <\/p>\n<p>For instance, pension contributions, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/the-employment-allowance-and-employers-national-insurance-contributions-67362.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">employer\u2019s National Insurance contributions<\/a>, amongst others that might apply. They\u2019re all additional costs to take into careful consideration before signing on the dotted line. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/calculators\/salary-calculator\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online salary calculator<\/a> to work out the cost of hiring staff or awarding a pay rise.<\/div>\n<h4>What if I can\u2019t afford to give my staff a pay rise?<\/h4>\n<p>It would be far worse to agree a pay rise which you can\u2019t really afford, only to struggle with the consequences. You\u2019ll compromise your mental wellbeing, but also put your business and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cash flow<\/a> at risk. <\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, sad as it is, an employee pay rise can\u2019t be your first priority. If you need to focus your spending elsewhere, explain why. Overpromising and under-delivering will cause problems in the future, but failing to discuss this with staff can damage morale and motivation. <\/p>\n<h4>Next stop: arrange a meeting with your accountant<\/h4>\n<p>Your accountant will be able to guide you through the long-term implications of awarding that pay rise, and whether or not your business is likely to be able to sustain it. Situations like this are precisely why we always advise keeping your records up to date! <\/p>\n<p>Running a business can be stressful, and there may well be situations that are out of your control. If you can\u2019t afford to issue a raise at the moment, there are still other options to explore. <\/p>\n<h3>Other ways to show your appreciation to staff<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re not yet in a position to award staff with a salary increase, or simply want to boost morale, there are other ways to show your appreciation. Think outside the box! This might look like: <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/how-much-holiday-is-my-employee-entitled-to-3817.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">An extra day of paid holiday<\/a><\/li>\n<li>An early finish<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/flexible-working-for-employers-5132.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flexible working hours, or working remotely<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Allow them to take their birthday off, free of charge<\/li>\n<li>Training programmes in skills they wish to acquire<\/li>\n<li>Staff benefits, such as gym memberships (just don\u2019t forget to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report any taxable benefits to HMRC<\/a>!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That\u2019s just the tip of the (generalised) iceberg! Consider the bigger picture -\u202fwanting to keep your workforce happy is not a bad thing. In fact, it\u2019s a very desirable trait for an employer to have, but awarding rises might not always be the only option. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
