There isn\u2019t a magic formula when it comes to working out your pricing, but there are some key factors worth considering. Like most business decisions, pricing starts with market research and working out your costs.<\/p>\n<h3>How much do your competitors charge?<\/h3>\n<p>We know that pricing up your services can feel terrifying when you\u2019re just starting out, even if you know what the market rate for your industry and level is. Will people pay it? Is it too cheap? Should you just give up at the first hurdle and admit defeat? Move to the moon maybe? Don\u2019t panic!<\/p>\n<p>The simplest way to start researching where you belong pricewise, is to look at what your competitors are charging. It\u2019s all about striking the balance between offering competitive prices and making sure you\u2019re not selling yourself short or limiting profit potential.<\/p>\n<p>Get into the finer details of this to see what they\u2019re offering for the fees they charge. For example, they might seem expensive, but include a lot of things you would class as optional extras (allowing your clients to pick and choose).<\/p>\n<h3>Working out your business costs<\/h3>\n<p>Profit is what\u2019s left over once you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/gross-and-net-profit-57146.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">deduct the business\u2019s expenses from the money it earns<\/a>. Understanding how much it costs to run the business will help you work out how you need to charge in order to make a profit.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping track of costs is also essential for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/claiming-for-business-expenses\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming tax relief on allowable expenses<\/a>, and making sure the business is as efficient as it can be. You might make lots of sales, but if your expenses are high then your profits might not look too healthy. It\u2019s one of the many reasons why a good accountant will preach the benefits of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/using-financial-reports-in-your-business-63750.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your financial reports<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/managing-your-spending-budget-in-your-business-5122.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">managing your business&#8217;s budget<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>Don\u2019t forget the admin cost of running a business<\/h4>\n<p>Sending invoices, collating receipts, submitting tax returns\u2026 it all takes time \u2013 which means less time available for billable work. The price you charge your clients should make this worth the effort!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/startup-business-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Startup accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only <strike>\u00a354.50<\/strike> \u00a332.70 per month <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How much do you need to earn for yourself?<\/h3>\n<p>Before you choose your superyacht, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/paying-yourself-through-your-business\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how much do you need to earn from the business<\/a> so you can pay all of your own bills? If this will be your only source of income, then it\u2019s also worth noting that self-employed people don\u2019t get paid time off in the same way that employees do. Factor sick pay and holidays into your pricing! <\/p>\n<h3>How experienced are you?<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re charging <em>how much<\/em> for fifteen minutes work?! Well, yes actually, because you\u2019ve had ten years of practice which is why you can do it in fifteen minutes. More knowledge and experience mean more value to the client, and that\u2019s worth paying for. <\/p>\n<h3>What charging method should you use?<\/h3>\n<p>Pricing up a job can be done in units depending on what best suits you. Some industries favour a particular method, such as skilled trades which tend to charge a day rate but really, it\u2019s up to you. Once you know how long something will take, you&#8217;ll be able to apply this to how you bill your clients and provide much more accurate quotes.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"20%\"><strong>Hourly rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">This can help you strike a balance between flexibility and making sure you don\u2019t end up doing more work than you quoted for. It can also be useful if you want to include time for amends in your quote to the client, so that they know these things don\u2019t come for free!<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"20%\"><strong>Day rate<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Similar to charging by the hour but more applicable for longer term or bigger scale projects.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"20%\"><strong>Fixed package fees<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">A set of standard service packages which you can then promote at fixed costs.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"20%\"><strong>Cost plus pricing<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Adding a mark-up onto your break-even value to ensure decent profit margin.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"20%\"><strong>Bespoke value pricing<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Adjusting prices per client or project to fit in around budgets or scale of requirements. This works well with loyal or repeat customers but may also leave you open to tricky negotiations.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h4>Why keeping track of time is so important for businesses<\/h4>\n<p>Although spending time on tracking your time might seem counterproductive on the surface, dig a little deeper and you\u2019ll find there are real benefits. See time-tracking as an investment for improving your overall performance and organisation, rather than another chore.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">It\u2019s also pretty handy for making sure you charge customers a price which actually reflects the work you\u2019re doing!<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nRecording your time in 15 or 30 minute segments can be especially useful. It\u2019ll help you spot the true value of all those \u201cquick phone calls\u201d, and make it easier to tot up the billable time you should be charging to clients if you charge by the hour.<\/p>\n<h4>Review your price list every 6 months<\/h4>\n<p>Those in the know recommend reviewing your pricing every six months. Check back in with your competitors, reassess the nature of your industry and evaluate what is and isn\u2019t working for you as a business.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I negotiate fees with clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Where possible, let them go first! They\u2019ll normally pitch lower than they\u2019re prepared to pay (the Golden Rule of haggling!), but to you it will be either:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Higher than you normally charge (wait till you\u2019re out of sight to start the victory dance)<\/li>\n<li>Acceptable, and you can decide whether to agree, negotiate, or ask for other considerations such as payment milestones<\/li>\n<li>Lower than normal. If it\u2019s so low that it\u2019s not even in the right ballpark, it\u2019s time to be polite but honest and let this one go. If it\u2019s a little low, it\u2019s time to negotiate!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you ever need to justify your pricing (even to yourself), remember that your clients won\u2019t pay employer costs, such as holiday pay, or National Insurance and pension contributions. And they want to hire you for a reason! <\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to offer alternatives either. For instance, changing the scope of the project, or breaking it down into chunks with their own payment milestones.<\/p>\n<h4>How can I change my prices without upsetting customers?<\/h4>\n<p>Like any business, you\u2019ll naturally want to raise your prices at some point. Whether this is to expand generally, to bring it in line with inflation or because you\u2019re in a rough patch, customers will come to expect it. That doesn\u2019t mean they like it very much.<\/p>\n<p>Raising your prices is a delicate balance between getting what you need and keeping your customers happy. A huge increase may be what you need to keep your business afloat but if there are no customers left, it\u2019ll have the opposite effect to what you want.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no point hoping your customers won\u2019t notice. Inform clients so they can review their own budgets \u2013 ideally giving them enough time to prepare. It can also help to explain why you need to raise the price.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit different if you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-could-registering-for-vat-affect-my-pricing-60729.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">adjust your pricing because you\u2019re registering for VAT<\/a>, but you should still let your clients know as soon as possible. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
