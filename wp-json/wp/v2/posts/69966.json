I develop websites and bespoke software applications which allow individuals and businesses to conduct their business online, and reach a wider community.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;During my last term of University, the UK went into strict lockdown.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With COVID, power outages, and University restrictions, finishing my degree was a challenge. But, sitting in my halls of residence, I thought a lot about the businesses facing hardship. Reports about local and national economic damage were a constant feature on the news.<\/p>\n<p>Immediately after graduating, I set up Godfrey Designs so I could use my skills to help businesses or individuals who have been financially hit during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>One of my first clients was a caf\u00e9 in Hampshire called Tanya\u2019s Kitchen. They first opened their doors in February, but were forced to close when lockdown hit shortly after.<\/p>\n<p>This was an incredibly difficult time for their new business and they did not have a functioning website to create an online presence for their store.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;I approached them to offer my services, so they could reach out to the wider community.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I set about creating a mobile-friendly website to promote their caf\u00e9, offering homemade cakes and afternoon tea.<\/p>\n<p>For another client I developed an online calculator for cushion foam. Users can enter specific measurements, select upgrade options, and purchase their products online.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;Having no prior real-life business experience, creating a business for the first time was a very daunting prospect.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time researching how to run a successful business to prepare myself. There is a wealth of information out there, which easily becomes overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>The main challenge for me was understanding the exact processes of setting up a business. Theory is one thing, but putting it into practice is another.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;Being cut off from other people, and having to communicate with clients solely over the phone makes the information gathering process more challenging.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To build a software product, you need to ensure you ask the right questions and gather enough information. As there were no in-person meetings, it was harder to communicate ideas through my usual process of sketches and illustrations.<\/p>\n<p>The testing and development process also became increasingly difficult, as I could not easily demonstrate the website or software.<\/p>\n<p>Using Zoom and other programs to demonstrate work has its own limitations, such as streaming quality. It\u2019s also dependent on the client&#8217;s technical ability to establish a connection with you.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;I had to deal with the stress of starting a new business in isolation.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Business-related tasks continually increased day-by-day in a very lonely environment, and this had an effect on my concentration and motivation.<\/p>\n<p>To adapt my business, I created an online portal where clients can easily view their products online.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of screen sharing over Zoom, clients can securely log in to a testing portal, viewing and testing the product in their own time. It\u00a0has been a great success.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;As a new start-up business, I quickly learnt the importance of value for money and ensuring overheads are as low as possible.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to continuing to help those struggling in this global outbreak, and believe a &#8216;success story\u2019 should not be about financial success. For me, it&#8217;s more about providing opportunities and success for others.<\/p>\n<p>I aim to provide a professional service for very little cost in comparison to other, more established, developers on the market. This way I can provide businesses with tools that enable them to adapt to the changing world.<\/p>\n<p>My main motivation is the positive feedback I receive and knowing that I have, in my own way, helped an independent business to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Mark Alexander Todd<\/h3>\n<p><a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pocketpicturesltd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Pocket Pictures Ltd<\/a> | <a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/pocket-courses.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Pocket Courses<\/a> |\u00a0<a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pocketpicturesltd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook<\/a> |\u00a0<a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/pocketpicturesltd\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a> |\u00a0<a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/markalexandertodd\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1200px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1200\/628;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 1200px; border-radius: 30px;\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Matt_Alexander_Todd.png\" alt=\"Mark Alexander Todd\" width=\"1200\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Pocket Pictures is a film and video production company. I am the founder of the company, but my day to day role is as creative director and filmmaker.<\/p>\n<p>All of my working life, I have been involved in making videos, films or TV series. In the 1990\u2019s I was a TV puppeteer on shows like Spitting Image, and films like The Muppet Christmas Carol.<\/p>\n<p>I was also involved in producing short films and directing commissioned BBC shows such as Digital Rebels.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;I have wandered away a couple of times, and started other businesses here and in the USA.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\"><\/h5>\n<p>But I still come back to producing media because I understand and love it \u2013 it\u2019s really what I was born to do.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a suitable working space is always a challenge. A studio is not an office, it falls somewhere in between an office and a light industrial unit.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Birmingham has many renovated factory spaces, so when we were contacted by MIA we jumped at the unit in The Telsen Centre.<\/p>\n<p>It provides us with good flexible \u2018studio space\u2019, and they don\u2019t mind if we attach video lights to the ceiling!<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;For obvious reasons, this year we have had to reinvent ourselves in some ways.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our in-house media training is now online and we launched our own training platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/pocket-courses.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">pocket-courses.com<\/a>. Now we create training packages for other companies in the same situation.<\/p>\n<p>We also have <a href=\"https:\/\/pocket-courses.com\/courses\/successful-selftapes-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">online courses to help actors create and produce their own professional selftapes<\/a>. It\u2019s great to see how businesses have been quick to explore new ways they can evolve and interact with customers, in the absence of the usual client-facing option.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;Because of travelling restrictions we have produced a number of projects with shorter production periods, and sometimes even virtually.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This included one project which we produced entirely via Zoom; a 7-part online comedy series called Isolation Nation for a comedian in Luton.<\/p>\n<p>I like to think of Pocket Pictures as a breathing company. When we have large contracts, we expand our freelance crew. On a day-to-day basis there are just two of us in the office \u2013 and the business work falls to me.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;I love the creative work I do, so I like to make my other \u2018business work\u2019 as simple and painless as possible.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When I first approached The Accountancy Partnership, I was looking for a simpler way to handle my accounts in light of the change to Making Tax Digital.<\/p>\n<p>I also like the business model of monthly payments, rather than one huge bill at year end. Plus, I\u2019d struggled with working KashFlow and in contrast, their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/free-bookkeeping-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pandle software<\/a> is much more \u2018me\u2019 friendly.<\/p>\n<p>I can honestly say TAP has helped me dramatically reduce the time I spend on accounts and invoicing. Add this to the fact that my accountancy costs have been reduced by 58%, and I am a very happy business owner, in a less than happy time.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;2021 will see us working with more companies to create online training, so we will add to our eclectic portfolio of training packages.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re also looking at how we can help companies get seen in the new post-COVID landscape.<\/p>\n<p>This is not a time for us, or any other company, to settle back on our laurels and say \u201ccome find us\u201d to potential clients.<\/p>\n<p>If we\u2019re not out there banging a drum, tooting our own horn, or any other orchestral metaphor you can think of, then we\u2019ll get lost in the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>So, thank you TAP for giving Pocket Pictures some extra time to create, not administrate!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Gemma Thompson<\/h3>\n<p><a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/diveproof.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Dive Proof<\/a> |\u00a0<a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/diveproof\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook<\/a> |\u00a0<a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/diveproof\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1200px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1200\/628;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 1200px; border-radius: 30px;\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Gemma_Thompson.png\" alt=\"Gemma Thompson\" width=\"1200\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Dive Proof is a specialist company offering custom waterproof log books and stationery. Grease proof, wipe-able, chemically resistant and environmentally friendly, these books can be written on using a normal ball point pen or pencil, and cannot be torn.<\/p>\n<p>Individual books can be personalised with names and photographs. We can also create completely bespoke items for dive schools and retailers.<\/p>\n<p>Hand made in the UK and designed by pros, these books are for those who work and play in all elements. Most importantly, they can withstand an evening on a pub table.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;I spent the first half of my twenties as a scuba diving instructor, working in Malaysia.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After that I was in Cyprus working as a scuba instructor training the military.<\/p>\n<p>Being outdoors, in and out of the ocean all day with lots of wet gear lying around, makes it difficult to keep documents and log books dry.<\/p>\n<p>The soggy log book seemed to be a common problem for my students and customers. I regularly had to hand out new log books and help people copy details over into a new one.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;There didn\u2019t really seem to be an obvious or easy solution to this problem, so Dive Proof was born.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The first decision I had to make was &#8216;how do I get these books made?&#8217; I taught myself to use Illustrator so did all the design work.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was looking at printing them in China, but then I might be stuck with thousands of them that I couldn\u2019t sell.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;It seemed a less risky option to print the books myself, so that was another new skill; printing, cutting and binding books.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m very glad I went down this route as my designs have evolved a lot in the last 3 years. It means I&#8217;m able to offer customised books for every customer \u2013 something that is now our USP!<\/p>\n<p>It also means we can work with retailers, adding their logo or branding for resale, or take on completely bespoke projects.<\/p>\n<p>We produce Nato Sequence of Order notebooks for Officer Cadets at Britannia Naval College, and Search and Rescue log books for the Scottish Ambulance Service.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;The first lockdown period, from March to May 2020, saw our sales drop to about 10-15% of what they were in previous months.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Luckily our overheads are relatively low, so we could still just about cover these and didn\u2019t end up at a loss. With diving not allowed in many countries, including the UK, there was just no demand for our product at all.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately our business bounced back straight away. June and July sales were comparable to the same time last year \u2013 I\u2019m still not sure how we managed that!<\/p>\n<p>Lockdown has taught us that it\u2019s good to have a finger in many pies, and not rely solely on one industry or source of income.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;We have some expansion plans in the pipeline so we can diversify to new markets.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I signed up with TAP due to how affordable they are. It was an easy monthly payment and I know exactly what I was getting for my money.\u00a0 The reason I stay (and recommend them to everyone who will listen), is because of how quick they are.<\/p>\n<p>I am a really impatient person. If I am 4 hours deep into some bookwork and need an answer desperately, I know they will get back to me really quickly. It\u2019s something I really appreciate!!<\/p>\n<p>We are hoping to launch a sister company which still specialises in waterproof printing, but will be trading under a more generic name.<\/p>\n<p>While mainly concentrating on B2B sales to provide clients with waterproof printing, we are hoping to also be a place for budding authors to self publish. For example, wipe clean cook books!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Claire Verney<\/h3>\n<p><a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dvact.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">DV-ACT Ltd<\/a> |\u00a0<a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dv_act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter<\/a> |\u00a0<a style=\"color: #2d74aa; padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Muli',sans-serif; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/dv-act-ltd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1200px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1200\/628;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 1200px; border-radius: 30px;\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Claire_Verney.png\" alt=\"Claire Verney\" width=\"1200\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I am the director and practice manager at DV-ACT.

I was very concerned for those families living with abusers in lockdown.<\/p>\n<p>We put together guidance to help those working with vulnerable families with safety planning. It drew hundreds of professionals to our site.<\/p>\n<p>Our expertise helps to guide professionals and the general public on how to support those living with abusers.<\/p>\n<p>We then began offering online video appointments using Zoom, feeling it was important that we kept working through lockdown.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: center;\">&#8220;Keeping children safe from abuse must never stop.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We plan to expand the treatment work we do with parents, so that programmes of work can be completed online.
