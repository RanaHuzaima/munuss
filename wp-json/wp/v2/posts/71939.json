Often it can make perfect sense: no expensive premises to pay rent and maintenance on, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/overheads-58502.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no large overheads<\/a>, and the flexibility to sell to people all over the world at any time of day or night. But, getting started online can be daunting with plenty of practical and financial considerations to tackle.<\/p>\n<h3>What is Ecommerce?<\/h3>\n<p>Ecommerce (the \u2018e\u2019 stands for electronic) simply refers to the practice of buying and selling goods and services online in exchange for money. It covers everything from running your own website, to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/what-you-need-to-know-about-selling-on-amazon-40025.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selling on Amazon<\/a>, and all sorts of business models in between. <\/p>\n<h3>How do I start an online business?<\/h3>\n<p>Pretty much anyone can start a business online with very few technical skills needed. Online entrepreneurs are popping up everywhere, with new ideas and dynamic ways of selling their services or products, or even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/tax-and-vat-for-online-dropshippers-89299.html#what-is-dropshipping\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dropshipping someone else&#8217;s<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Sadly, throwing together a website, setting up a few social media pages, and creating a smart logo, isn\u2019t going to make you a millionaire (although you might be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-on-my-hobby-side-business-13671.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launch it as a hobby side-business<\/a>). So, what should you do to start an online business?<\/p>\n<h4>Be clear on your objectives<\/h4>\n<p>What is it you want your online business to do? In other words, are you simply selling products for a profit, or are you looking to raise awareness of something? Some platforms, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/does-my-small-business-need-to-sell-on-tiktok-229418.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">such as TikTok Shop<\/a>, can help you do both at the same time from a single app.<\/p>\n<h4>Plan your resources<\/h4>\n<p>You may not make money straight from day 1. Building your customer base and turning a profit can take months \u2013 even years. With this in mind, make sure you can manage financially in the meantime, either via alternative employment, savings, loans, investment, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/fundraising-and-finance\/grants\/are-government-grants-taxable-3823.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grants<\/a>, or other income.<\/p>\n<h4>Know where you\u2019ll store any stock<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re offering a service, such as copywriting, you probably won\u2019t have any specific stock to worry about. But if you\u2019re offering a practical trade or selling goods online, you\u2019ll need to consider how you\u2019ll source and store tools, materials, and stock. That said, even service-based e-commerce businesses need somewhere to operate from!<\/p>\n<h4>Decide which online sales platform will work best<\/h4>\n<p>Even if you\u2019ll be selling entirely online, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/does-my-business-need-a-website-60723.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you don\u2019t necessarily need a website of your own<\/a>. Online marketplaces (like Amazon, or Etsy) allow you to set up your own shop on their platform, and use their payment processing systems to manage your sales.<\/p>\n<p>Bear in mind that some platforms are better suited to certain types of products than others. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-if-i-start-selling-on-etsy-83664.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Etsy is great for handmade goods<\/a>, whilst People Per Hour is better for freelancers providing short projects.<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of advantages, including better security, and a simpler route to potential customers who search the platform for products or services likes yours. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/paying-tax-when-you-sell-through-online-marketplaces-78286.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paying tax if you sell through an online marketplace<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>Building an online business with credibility<\/h3>\n<p>Your online business starts the moment you begin building your website or online store, not when it goes live. Before you start, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/marketing\/creating-a-marketing-plan-for-your-small-business-55696.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research who your competitors are<\/a> and what is working for them. You could even trial what the buying experience is like from their website or shop, and see how you can improve it.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re selling products through a website, or providing a digital service, it has a better chance of success if it looks trustworthy and well designed. As consumers and service-users we\u2019re primed to trust providers which look more presentable. You can improve your online reputation by:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Making sure your website has a security certificate (such as SSL) so that visitors don\u2019t see security warnings.<\/li>\n<li>Offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-the-best-way-to-take-invoice-payments-from-clients-13511.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">different payment methods<\/a>\/ways to sign-up\/book you. This lets customers use the method they feel most comfortable with.<\/li>\n<li>Inviting customers to leave reviews across a variety of review sites. This means other potential customers can research you, see what you\u2019re good (or bad!) at, and how you deal with issues.<\/li>\n<li>Provide different contact methods &#8211; again, so that customers can choose the one they feel most comfortable with. It also reassures buyers that they can contact you if something goes wrong.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whilst opening a physical shop on the high street gives you natural visibility from passing traffic, the same isn\u2019t true about launching a website. To help things along you might use online adverts through a search engine or on social media, or position yourself as a result for relevant searches (known as SEO). If digital marketing sounds overwhelming, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/digital-marketing-for-beginners\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">take a look at our guide<\/a> to learn more.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/amazon-ecommerce-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Ecommerce accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Accounting for eCommerce sellers from \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What practical and tax considerations are there when setting up a business online?<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re planning your ecommerce strategy, you\u2019ll need to plan for things like order fulfilment, postage and packaging, marketing, and tax.<\/p>\n<h4>How will you market your product or service?<\/h4>\n<p>Having a really clear and logical marketing strategy that both you and your customers understand is what makes the difference between putting up an online shop, and it actually making any sales. Think about who you\u2019re selling to, and what is most likely to attract their attention. IT\u2019S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT BEING THE LOUDEST VOICE.<\/p>\n<h4>What your payment and delivery options will be<\/h4>\n<p>What steps will your customers take in placing an order with you? You also need to determine how you\u2019ll work out your delivery costs and whether you\u2019ll pass these on to customers or not. If you\u2019re selling to customers abroad, make sure you\u2019re clear on any customs and excise duties too. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/how-much-should-i-charge-for-my-services-6106.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pricing strategy<\/a> is a key part of this, so again, do lots of research. <\/p>\n<h4>What tax you\u2019ll need to pay<\/h4>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re selling products or services online, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">making more than the \u00a31,000 Trading Allowance from it<\/a>, you\u2019ll need to inform HMRC and pay any tax due.<\/p>\n<p>HMRC considers most types of online selling as a trade. So, if you\u2019re doing any of the following, you\u2019re highly like to need to pay tax:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Making a profit (rather than simply selling to raise emergency funding or selling for fun)<\/li>\n<li>Modifying products to generate a higher profit<\/li>\n<li>Selling items for similar prices that other retailers are selling them for<\/li>\n<li>Carrying out lots of similar transactions across a short period of time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list but as a general rule of thumb, make sure you seek professional accountancy advice if you\u2019re not sure.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 340px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 340\/451;margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"If you earn less than the trading allowance\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Do_I_Need_to_Pay_Tax_on_My_Side-Hustle_Hobby_Business_.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 340px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 340\/451;margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"If you earn more than the trading allowance\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Do_I_Need_to_Pay_Tax_on_My_Side-Hustle_Hobby_Business_-1.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>How much tax will I have to pay as an online business?<\/h3>\n<p>This depends on several things, including how much money you\u2019re making and whether you\u2019ve exceeded your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">personal tax allowance<\/a> for the year. <\/p>\n<p>Businesses pay tax on the profits they make after deducting expenses, rather than the full amount of income they receive, so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming tax relief on your allowable business expenses<\/a> can be an efficient way to reduce your bill! <\/p>\n<p>These can vary from one business to the next, and could include anything which is &#8220;wholly and exclusively&#8221; for the business, such as postage and packaging, internet hosting for your website, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/can-i-reclaim-transaction-fees-as-an-expense-166713.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transaction fees charged by the payment handler or platform<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-type-of-tax-return-do-i-need-to-submit-2566.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">What type of tax return you need to submit<\/a> depends on how you have structured your business.<\/p>\n<h4>Income Tax<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re employed, the organisation you work for will deal with your tax for you which will show on your payslips. However, if you sell online for your own business, that income will be classed for tax purposes as self-employed (even if you\u2019re also employed elsewhere at the same time).<\/p>\n<p>Self-employed income needs to be reported to HMRC. Just so you know, you may not need to pay any tax on the first \u00a31,000 of self-employed income that you earn in a tax year. This is due to the Trading Allowance, and is great for micro businesses in particular. It\u2019s a form of tax relief (one of many which we cover in our article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/tax-relief-for-the-self-employed-3833.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Relief for the Self-Employed<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h4>National Insurance<\/h4>\n<p>Paying <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/national-insurance\/for-self-employed-businesses-22965.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Insurance contributions when you&#8217;re self-employed<\/a> means you can access a UK state pension as well as other benefits. How much you\u2019ll need to pay depends on whether you\u2019re employed or self-employed, what type of business you\u2019re running and if you\u2019re employing any staff.<\/p>\n<h4>Corporation Tax<\/h4>\n<p>If your business is set up as a limited company, you\u2019ll need to submit a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Company Tax Return<\/a> each year.<\/p>\n<h4>VAT<\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-rates-and-thresholds\/how-much-is-vat-in-the-uk-200582.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">standard VAT rate in the UK<\/a> is 20%. However, some products and services (such as electricity, gas, or heating oil for domestic and residential use or for non-business use by a charity) are charged at 5%. Children\u2019s clothing is charged at 0%.<\/p>\n<p>If your business has a turnover of more than \u00a390,000, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-do-i-register-for-vat-our-guide-to-vat-registration-93406.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for VAT<\/a>, and submit regular returns to tell HMRC about the VAT you charge on sales and pay on purchases.<\/p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/should-i-voluntarily-register-for-vat-early-14770.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voluntarily register for VAT early<\/a> if you want to, but once your VAT-taxable turnover goes over \u00a390,000 in a 12-month period (or if you expect to within the next 30 days) it\u2019s mandatory to sign up as soon as possible.
