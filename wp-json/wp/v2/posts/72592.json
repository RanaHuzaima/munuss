Flexible working, the chance to choose your own projects, and the freedom to be your own boss make it a popular choice.<\/p>\n<p>But the fact is, branching out with a sparkling new business of your very own can be pretty scary. Telling HMRC that you\u2019re self-employed and making sure you pay the right amount of tax are important starting points, so we\u2019ve put together this article to help.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a sole trader?<\/h3>\n<p>A sole trader is someone who runs their own business as an individual. With this type of structure there\u2019s no legal distinction between you and the business, so you&#8217;re considered to be one and the same.<\/p>\n<p>This means that you\u2019re personally responsible for any liabilities in the business (such as repaying loans), so your personal assets can be at risk if the business struggles to pay its bills. <\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/soletrader\/what-are-the-benefits-of-being-a-sole-trader-3699.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the benefits of being a sole trader<\/a> is that you can simply keep any profit after paying your tax bill.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also much easier and quicker to set yourself up as a sole trader, with far fewer rules and paperwork than you might encounter if you use a different business structure.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/which-legal-structure-should-i-choose-when-i-start-a-business-14385.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Choosing a Business Structure<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>Is a sole trader the same as being self-employed?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self_employed\/the-beginners-guide-to-self-employment-3740.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Being self-employed means that you own and run your own business<\/a>, and being a sole trader is one of the ways that you can do this. The two terms are often used interchangeably!<\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to set up as a sole trader?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re an individual who earns income from self-employment which is less than the \u00a31,000 Trading Allowance, then you might not need to tell HMRC or pay tax on this part of your income. You can claim the Trading Allowance even if you earn money from another source too, such as an employer that you work for full-time. <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trading Allowance<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>Can I give my sole trader business a name?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, even though there\u2019s no legal distinction between you and the business and you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/soletrader\/does-a-sole-trader-need-to-register-with-companies-house-7654.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">don\u2019t need to register with Companies House<\/a>, sole traders can still choose to run their business under a different name. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great chance to get creative and make it obvious what your business is or does, but make sure it\u2019s not the same (or very similar to) any business name that already exists. It mustn\u2019t be offensive in any way either, or suggest a connection with a local authority or government body. Additionally, you can\u2019t add \u2018Ltd\u2019 or \u2018LLP\u2019, as you would for a company or partnership.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/sole-trader-accounting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Sole Trader accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How do I set up a sole trader business?<\/h3>\n<p>To get started you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/registering\/how-does-a-sole-trader-register-for-self-assessment-14776.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for Self Assessment as a sole trader<\/a>.
