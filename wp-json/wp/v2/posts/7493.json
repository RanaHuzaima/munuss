But as the days go past, the silence from your customer or client is deafening and the uneasiness starts to grow. Late payments and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-are-trade-debtors-202980.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trade debtors<\/a> can bring big headaches for small businesses, but there are things that might help mitigate the risk, and deal with it if it does happen. <\/p>\n<h3>Late payments and cash flow<\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, late payments often mean money leaves your business before more comes in. This can, understandably, create a fair bit of strain. Where possible, try to take steps that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leave your cash flow healthy enough to tide you over<\/a> if payments from clients aren\u2019t forthcoming. <\/p>\n<p>A good way to do this is to regularly update your cash flow forecast so you can plan your financial situation accurately. It\u2019s also worth checking in with your customers to see if they\u2019re experiencing any financial difficulties that make late payment (or even worse, non-payment) more likely. Make a plan based on your current financial position and revisit it often so you can spot any variances. <\/p>\n<h3>What steps can I take to minimise late payments?<\/h3>\n<p>Prevention, as they say, is always better than cure. By taking a few steps early on, you could save yourself a world of pain later. From pre-deadline reminders to updated credit terms, there are plenty of options available.  <\/p>\n<h4>Get to know your customers<\/h4>\n<p>A good relationship between your business and your customers goes a long way. It can keep communication flowing if they run into difficulties and builds trust. You also stand a better chance of spotting any potential issues before they arise. Regularly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/creditors-and-debtors-39738.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your debtor report<\/a> will help you understand what they&#8217;re really like to do business with!<\/p>\n<h4>Agree payment terms from the outset<\/h4>\n<p>Setting out invoice payment terms clearly, from the beginning, can go a long way towards minimising any awkward conversations in the future. You\u2019ll know when to reasonably expect the payment, which is essential for financial planning, and means you can send pre-emptive payment reminders leading up to the deadline (and possibly more sternly worded ones after it!). You might also consider:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Charging a deposit up front for work<\/li>\n<li>Adding fees for late payment<\/li>\n<li>Reducing the length of your payment terms<\/li>\n<li>Offering a discount for early payment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For longer contracts you might consider setting a payment schedule to improve cash flow for all involved, allowing your customer to spread the bill across a series of payments, whilst giving you regular income rather than waiting for payment on completion. <\/p>\n<p>Whatever it looks like for your business, get your invoicing and payment terms set in stone early so everyone knows where they stand. <\/p>\n<h4>Make sure your invoices are prompt and correct<\/h4>\n<p>When you\u2019re sending out lots of different invoices regularly, it\u2019s easy to make a mistake. Accurate invoices stand much more chance of being processed quickly, but errors can cost you serious time and money. <\/p>\n<p>Check and double <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/how-do-i-create-an-invoice-226903.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check each invoice thoroughly before sending<\/a>. Make sure the correct bank details are on there, as well as a breakdown of the work that has been completed (or products supplied). <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">There should also be a unique invoice number present, plus your contact details and the address of the business you\u2019re sending it to.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe more detail you can give on your invoices the better, but accuracy really is key. And of course, make sure you are sending your invoice to the correct person within the business you\u2019re sending it to. Otherwise, you risk it \u2018going round the houses\u2019 which tends to delay payment even more. And don&#8217;t forget to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-the-best-way-to-take-invoice-payments-from-clients-13511.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mention the payment methods you accept<\/a>!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/bookkeeping-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Bespoke bookkeeping service<\/h3>\n<p>From just \u00a320.00 per month (up to 40 transactions)<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>My customer\u2019s payment is late. What\u2019s the first step I should take?<\/h3>\n<p>You need a reliable system in place to deal with late payments swiftly &#8211; and preferably before it escalates to the debt recovery stage. Follow up any non-payment with an email, a letter and a phone call. Often customers have simply forgotten to pay, and a friendly reminder does the trick. <\/p>\n<h4>No joy. What should I do next?<\/h4>\n<p>If you still haven\u2019t had any luck, it\u2019s worth sending at least one email as a follow up. You might want to give them a call too. Be firm but polite and try not to let any emotion get in the way. Don\u2019t damage the good relationship you\u2019ve built up! After all, it\u2019s not usually the case that they don\u2019t want to pay you, it\u2019s that they\u2019re struggling to pay for some reason. <\/p>\n<p>During your chasing, it may come to light that your customer is having financial difficulties. Where this is the case, see if you can come to an arrangement where they pay in instalments or through a payment plan.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Yes, it might be painful to your cash flow, but any payment is generally better than no payment.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nAfter all this, the amount of money owed and how late it is will determine your next steps. Unfortunately, if you\u2019re still not getting anywhere, you might need to consider legal action. <\/p>\n<h4>Charging interest on late payments<\/h4>\n<p>Get in touch with your client in writing to tell them you will be looking to charge interest on the outstanding payment, as per your statutory right. This interest may be set up to 8% over the Bank of England base rate. You may also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/late-commercial-payments-interest-debt-recovery\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">seek compensation relating to debt recovery costs under Late Payment legislation<\/a>. Make sure they are clear that unless payment is made immediately you will be taking legal action where necessary. <\/p>\n<h4>Pause or cancel work<\/h4>\n<p>If they still don\u2019t pay, stop any further work for them until payment has been made. Your work (or service\/product) will likely be valuable to them, and they may not want to lose your support. <\/p>\n<h4>Is it still worth the effort?<\/h4>\n<p>Think about the commercial reality. If your client has no available funds or is insolvent, further action probably won\u2019t help. Again, if you\u2019re aware that severe financial difficulties or insolvency are at play, seek legal advice. <\/p>\n<h4>Taking legal advice for late payments<\/h4>\n<p>Your customer still isn\u2019t paying, and the payment deadline has long passed. Now what? This might be the point where you consider taking legal advice so you can plan what route to take next.  <\/p>\n<p>If the amount owed is particularly large, or you\u2019re worried the customer will struggle to pay at all, you need a procedure in place to follow. This will also help you stay consistent if the problem ever arises again!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our online accounting services for businesses.
