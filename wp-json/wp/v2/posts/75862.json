In this guide we&#8217;ll go over what you need to know if your business exports from the UK to the EU.<\/p>\n<h3>Am I an exporter?<\/h3>\n<p>Goods moving across the UK border are classed as imports or exports (depending on which direction they go in!), so you&#8217;ll normally be considered an exporter if you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/importing-and-exporting\/how-do-i-export-from-the-uk-1790.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">provide goods or services to another country outside of the UK<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As a businesses you&#8217;ll need <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/importing-and-exporting\/what-is-an-eori-number-25817.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a UK Economic Operator\u2019s Registration and Identification (EORI) number<\/a> to export goods. An EORI number is used to identify businesses which have permission to move goods out of the UK.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to charge VAT on goods I export from the UK to the EU?<\/h3>\n<p>VAT is charged based on the &#8216;place of supply&#8217;, so if you&#8217;re sending goods and services across the border, you can&#8217;t charge UK VAT on it. This means UK VAT registered businesses should zero-rate the UK VAT on exports they make from the UK to the EU.<\/p>\n<h4>Why is the UK VAT on exports zero-rated?<\/h4>\n<p>UK VAT is only charged on products or services which are for use in the UK. If the goods aren\u2019t for use in the UK, then UK VAT doesn\u2019t apply.<\/p>\n<p>The goods are still taxable, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/the-vat-jargon-buster-for-businesses-7764.html#zero-rated-items\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">but the UK VAT is zero-rated<\/a>, which means the rate of UK VAT charged is 0%. You\u2019ll still need to account for zero-rated VAT on exports in your VAT return.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">This doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no VAT to pay.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe key point here is <em>UK<\/em> VAT. Only the UK VAT is zero-rated on exports. The buyer will still need to pay VAT in the country that the goods are used in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The process for this depends on whether the buyer is a business or a private consumer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Business to business sales (B2B) &#8211; where a business sells goods to another business.<\/li>\n<li>Business to consumer sales (B2C) &#8211; where a business sells directly to the customer, for their own private use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Exporting from the UK to EU businesses<\/h3>\n<p>If the buyer is a business, you\u2019ll need to make sure that they are able to act as an importer for the goods. This includes asking for their EU <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/importing-and-exporting\/what-is-an-eori-number-25817.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EORI number<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You won\u2019t have to charge them VAT, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/how-do-i-create-an-invoice-226903.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the customs invoice must show the value of the goods<\/a> so they can pay import VAT at their country\u2019s border.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/vat-return-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive VAT return service<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a340.00 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>VAT when exporting from the UK to EU consumers<\/h3>\n<p>The process for VAT is different depending on whereabouts in the UK your business is based, because there are special rules in place for Northern Ireland.<\/p>\n<h4>If your business is in Northern Ireland<\/h4>\n<p>Northern Ireland has a special arrangement with the EU which enables businesses there to continue selling to EU consumers under distance selling rules. <\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>What are the distance selling rules?<\/h4>\n<p>Distance selling means you are quite literally selling at a distance (such as online or through a catalogue), rather than selling in-person, such as in a shop.<\/p>\n<p>The EU has processes which help distance sellers deal with VAT when they sell directly to consumers in other EU countries. These rules allow them to charge VAT at the other country\u2019s rate, without registering for VAT there.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the seller reports the VAT when they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/how-do-i-submit-a-vat-return-14690.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit a VAT return in their own country<\/a>. That is, until they hit the distance selling threshold, at which point <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/vat-registration\/how-do-i-register-for-vat-our-guide-to-vat-registration-93406.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the seller must register for VAT in that country<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>The \u20ac10,000 distance selling threshold applies to the total amount of cross-border sales that the business makes. For example, a business in Italy could reach the threshold by making \u20ac5,000 of sales to France, and \u20ac5,000 of sales to Germany.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Businesses in Northern Ireland can either register for VAT in each EU country they sell to, or opt in to the EU&#8217;s One Stop Shop (OSS) to report the VAT on distance sales. <\/p>\n<p>You can register for the One Stop Shop (OSS) alongside your normal VAT return, but you&#8217;ll need to submit an OSS return detailing all your distance sales to EU consumers, as well as sending your regular VAT return. When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/how-do-i-pay-my-vat-bill-3709.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pay your VAT bill<\/a>, any taxes owed to other countries will be sent on as appropriate. <\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to do this until the total amount of distance sales reaches the \u20ac10,000 threshold, at which point you\u2019ll need to register for VAT in the country you\u2019re selling to.<\/p>\n<h4>If your business is in Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland)<\/h4>\n<p>You won&#8217;t be able to report the VAT on EU distance-sales through your UK VAT return to HMRC, even if your sales are less than the distance selling threshold. If you\u2019re a GB-based business which sells to EU customers, then you have two choices.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone lazyload\" style=\"border-radius: 30px; border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 700px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 25px rgba(0,0,0,.1); box-shadow: 0px 0px 25px rgba(0,0,0,.1);\" title=\"What should I do when distance selling?\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/How-to-Prepare-for-Distance-Selling-VAT-Changes.svg\" alt=\"Infographic showing what steps to take to prepare for VAT changes to distance selling\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h5>Move some of your stock to somewhere in the EU<\/h5>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to register for VAT in the country where you hold the stock.
