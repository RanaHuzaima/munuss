There are pros and cons to each, and what works for one business might not be a good fit for another. <\/p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re looking at going into business with someone else (or multiple other people) and you want to limit your own personal liability, then two options you might consider are setting up a limited company, or registering a Limited Liability Partnership. We explain how they&#8217;re different, who might find each structure most useful, and how to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>Tax in a limited company versus an LLP<\/h3>\n<p>One of the key differences between limited companies and LLPs is the treatment of tax. A limited company is completely separate from the people in the business, so for tax this means:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>A limited company pays tax in its own right, by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submitting a Company Tax Return and paying Corporation Tax<\/a> on any taxable profits.<\/li>\n<li>The directors pay tax separately on the income they earn from the business. Their income could be from a salary which the company pays them. If the directors are also shareholders, then they might also receive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/dividends-and-taking-a-salary\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a share of the company&#8217;s profits in the form of dividends<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An LLP as an entity <em>isn&#8217;t<\/em> taxable, but the members\u00a0<em>are<\/em>. So, no Company Tax Return, and no Corporation Tax for an LLP. Instead, the untaxed profits are distributed to its members. They then pay tax on the value of their portion by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">completing a Self Assessment tax return<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Other similarities and differences for companies and LLPs<\/h3>\n<p>Both limited companies and LLP are registered at Companies House, and both must <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-annual-accounts-13527.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">file annual accounts<\/a>, but the way that they raise funds and pay members from the business is different. <\/p>\n<p>The company can sell shares in exchange for capital investment &#8211; basically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/shares\/selling-shares-of-a-private-company-14763.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selling a chunk of the business to raise money<\/a>. In an LLP there are no shares, shareholders, or directors, so they don&#8217;t have this option. <\/p>\n<h4>Public information for companies and LLPs<\/h4>\n<p>Whilst a limited company&#8217;s information (known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-model-articles-of-association-in-a-limited-company-196848.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Articles of Association<\/a>) are publicly available at Companies House, an LLP&#8217;s version of this (a Members\u2019 Agreement) is private.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Personal liability for limited companies and LLPs<\/h4>\n<p>Private limited companies are &#8216;limited&#8217; because they &#8216;limit&#8217; the amount of personal responsibility that members of the business have for any debts. In a private limited company, the personal responsibility (or &#8216;liability&#8217;) of the owners is restricted to the value of their investments or guarantees to the company.<\/p>\n<p>An LLP is a bit like a combination of a normal partnership in terms of tax liability. But, like a limited company, each partner has reduced financial liability. This means that partners aren&#8217;t responsible for each others conduct (or negligence). <\/p>\n<p>Members agree an amount that they guarantee to pay should the business run into difficulty, and record it in the partnership agreement outlining their rights and responsibilities.<\/p>\n<h3>How many people do I need to set up a company or an LLP?<\/h3>\n<p>LLPs must have at least two partners as designated members, but there\u2019s no maximum on how many you can have. You could even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dormant-company\/dormant-companies-explained-8202.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set up a dormant limited company<\/a>, and use that as the second member in your LLP.<\/p>\n<p>As a member of an LLP, there are some duties you must perform.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Filing annual accounts and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-is-a-confirmation-statement-91784.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmation statements<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/llp-limited-liability-partnership\/setting-up-and-running-an-llp-107283.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Registering the LLP for Self-Assessment<\/a> and VAT if applicable<\/li>\n<li>Reporting any changes to HMRC and Companies House where necessary<\/li>\n<li>Maintaining accounts or appointing an accountant<\/li>\n<li>Representing the LLP in any legal matters<\/li>\n<li>Making sure the LLP is adhering to all forms of statutory compliance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In a limited company it&#8217;s not unusual for one person to own, manage and register the company by themselves, acting as both director and shareholder.

LLPs are useful for companies that usually operate as a partnership, such as accountancy firms or solicitors. It&#8217;s also worth noting that LLPs can&#8217;t be used for non-profit purposes, so you should set up a limited company if you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/community-interest-companies\/accounting-for-not-for-profits-and-community-interest-companies-116137.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">operate a non-profit organisation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Reasons to set up a Limited Liability Partnership<\/h4>\n<p>Setting up as a partnership is a good idea if you\u2019re planning to go into business with other people. In an LLP you&#8217;ll still be able to protect your private assets if the business does fail. <\/p>\n<p>An LLP is also more flexible if you know you want to add or remove people in the business, whereas the structure of a limited company is more rigid. For some people though, this is a good thing, as it means everyone in the business must agree to any changes.<\/p>\n<h4>Reasons to choose a limited company<\/h4>\n<p>If you plan to raise money for the business (or to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/how-do-i-sell-my-limited-company-101874.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sell some or all of the business<\/a> in the future) then operating a limited company will allow you to do this.
