Occasional online selling to get rid of unwanted clothes is one thing, but if it\u2019s something you intend to do regularly, or at volume, you may well need to declare your extra income to HMRC &#8211; and pay tax.<\/p>\n<h3>Am I an online seller?<\/h3>\n<p>If you sell something online then yes, technically you\u2019re an online seller. Ecommerce is a broad term which describes the process of trading goods and services on the internet. There are lots of ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/how-do-i-start-an-ecommerce-business-online-71939.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">start an ecommerce business selling online<\/a>, from freelancing platforms, streaming sites, online marketplaces, and beyond to your own ecommerce website. <\/p>\n<h3>What is an online marketplace?<\/h3>\n<p>Online marketplaces are just like real-life marketplaces, except they\u2019re online. Think of them as virtual shopping centres, with lots of different brands and retailers all in one place &#8211; examples might include Etsy, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/does-my-small-business-need-to-sell-on-tiktok-229418.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok Shop<\/a>, and Amazon. It\u2019s easy for buyers to browse and not need to jump from website to website, and listings will all follow the same format.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see the term &#8216;online marketplace&#8217; used by HMRC, and they define it as a business which uses a website or app to deal with the sale of goods to customers and:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Sets the terms and conditions on how goods are supplied to customers<\/li>\n<li>Is involved with authorising or facilitating customer payments<\/li>\n<li>Deals with the ordering or delivery of goods<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What\u2019s the difference between an online marketplace and an ecommerce website?<\/h4>\n<p>E-commerce websites are slightly different in that they are owned and managed by individual businesses that only sell products and services they choose. Only the people who own the site can create listings, and they have full control over how everything looks and works.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 700px;\" title=\"Difference between ecommerce website and online marketplace\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Difference-between-an-online-marketplace-and-an-ecommerce-website.svg\" alt=\"Difference between ecommerce website and online marketplace\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>How do I choose which one to use?<\/h4>\n<p>It all depends on what it is that you want to sell, and what you\u2019re hoping to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>Online marketplaces typically have a high volume of visitors already. They\u2019re a bit like the online equivalent of a busy market where lots of your potential customers are already shopping. The downside is that there\u2019s also more competition from your fellow stallholders!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 600px;\" title=\"New Seller Tasks\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/New-Seller-Tasks.svg\" alt=\"New Seller Tasks\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s usually quicker to get started selling through an online marketplace than it is to set up your own website, especially if you don\u2019t have much technical knowledge. It also means you don\u2019t have to spend time and money building your own site and paying for the hosting and ongoing management.<\/p>\n<p>Selling through an online marketplace isn\u2019t free, though! You\u2019ll usually surrender some sort of commission on sales, and there might also be fees &#8211; even if you don\u2019t make any sales.<\/p>\n<p>Some online marketplaces have a particular focus. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/freelancer\/side-hustle\/will-i-be-taxed-if-i-sell-my-old-clothes-online-231319.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selling unwanted clothes taking up space in your wardrobe<\/a> might be a job for eBay or Vinted, whilst providing personalised wedding favours might be better suited <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/do-i-need-to-pay-tax-if-i-start-selling-on-etsy-83664.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to selling on Etsy<\/a>.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to pay tax if I sell online?<\/h3>\n<p>Thanks to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trading Allowance you can earn up to \u00a31,000<\/a> in a single tax year from self-employment or \u2018miscellaneous income\u2019 such as online selling, without needing to report it to HMRC. The allowance is available even if you have another source of income, such as a full-time job for an employer.

If not, you could end up needing to pay the tax back later, along with some heavy fines and additional interest. If your income reaches the \u00a31,000 threshold in a tax year, then you will need to register as self-employed and start paying tax. <\/p>\n<h4>What about if I sell to a different country?<\/h4>\n<p>This is where things can get a little more complicated. For example, if you\u2019re a creator and use Patreon, then this is a US company registered for tax in the United States. As such, they\u2019ll expect you to withhold some of your earnings to pay US tax, but if you\u2019re based in the UK then HMRC will also expect to collect some tax from you &#8211; on the same earnings! <\/p>\n<p>Thankfully <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-happens-if-i-pay-tax-in-two-countries-112927.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the UK has double-taxation agreements in place<\/a> which mean you normally won\u2019t pay tax twice on the same amount of money. In Patreon\u2019s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/the-tax-on-creativity-tax-for-uk-patreon-creators-94675.html#patreon-and-tax-for-uk-creators\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you\u2019ll need to complete a W-8BEN form<\/a> to confirm you\u2019re a UK taxpayer, and you won\u2019t need to pay US taxes. <\/p>\n<h3>What taxes do online sellers need to pay?<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-type-of-tax-return-do-i-need-to-submit-2566.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">type of tax that you need to pay<\/a> can depend on how you structure your business and can also be affected by how much it makes. For example:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Sole traders submit Self Assessment tax returns, and pay Income Tax and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/national-insurance\/for-self-employed-businesses-22965.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Insurance on their profits<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Limited companies submit Company Tax Returns and pay Corporation Tax.
