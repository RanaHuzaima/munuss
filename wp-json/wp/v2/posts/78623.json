We&#8217;ve prepared this guide to explain what this might mean for declaring and paying tax on any earnings you make from a property rental, and ways that you may be able to save money.<\/p>\n<h3>Am I allowed to rent my property as a holiday let?<\/h3>\n<p><em>Maybe.<\/em> Whether you&#8217;re looking to let the whole property or just a bit of it, if it&#8217;s mortgaged you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/renting-out-your-property-a-checklist-for-landlords-110766.html#do-i-need-permission-to-rent-the-property-out\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check your lender\u2019s terms and conditions<\/a> around renting it out to anyone.<\/p>\n<p>Some lenders can be very specific about what they allow, and breaking their rules can have very harsh &#8211; not to mention expensive &#8211; consequences. Having said that, if you\u2019re honest about your plans, many mortgage providers will consider requests on a case-by-case basis (though this might be subject to additional fees).<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Check with your mortgage provider, freeholder, or landlord before renting out.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nGenerally speaking, short term lets aren\u2019t a problem. If you plan to rent out the property for longer periods then you may need to switch mortgages. This is why it\u2019s so important to check with your lender early on, and discuss your plans with them.<\/p>\n<p>Also bear in mind that if you rent the property yourself, or if it belongs to a council or housing association, then subletting may not be permitted. So again, seek permission first.<\/p>\n<h3>Is Airbnb classed as being self-employed?<\/h3>\n<p>When the whole of a property (or a part of it) is rented out, the resultant income is classed as rental income. It\u2019s easy to get confused here, because Airbnb hosts are making money as a small business\/sole trader, so it does look like they\u2019re self-employed. But actually, they\u2019re not &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/do-landlords-pay-tax-60715.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and different tax rules apply<\/a>.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/property-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Property accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Accounting for landlords and investors from \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Do I have to pay tax on Airbnb income?<\/h3>\n<p>You must declare any property or self-employment income if the total amount you receive from it in a tax year is more than \u00a31,000. This is thanks to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax-free trading allowance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>What does the trading allowance mean for Airbnb rental income?<\/h4>\n<p>The trading allowance means that you can earn up to \u00a31,000 of property income or as a sole trader each tax year, and you won\u2019t have to declare this to HMRC. If you have both types of income (you&#8217;re a sole trader <em>and<\/em> you earn money from property) you\u2019ll get a \u00a31,000 allowance for each.<\/p>\n<h4>What happens if I earn more than the allowance?<\/h4>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to register with HMRC, and declare the earnings that you make from renting out your property on Airbnb (or whichever method you might be using). <\/p>\n<h4>Will HMRC know about my Airbnb rental income?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a very good chance they will! Platforms such as Airbnb fall under <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-digital-platform-reporting-rules-mean-for-your-side-hustle-225885.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the digital platform reporting rules<\/a>, so they&#8217;re required to collect information about what you earn from renting out your property through the site, and then report this to HMRC. You&#8217;ll receive a copy of the data they pass on, so it&#8217;s crucial to ensure this is accurate.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I pay tax on Airbnb income?<\/h3>\n<p>To declare your income as a sole trader, you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/registering\/how-does-a-sole-trader-register-for-self-assessment-14776.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for Self Assessment<\/a> by 5th October following the end of the tax year that you need to report income for. Once registered, you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit Self Assessment tax returns<\/a> and provide the details of all your earnings from that tax year, including anything you might already have paid tax on, such as wages from an employer.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/should-i-own-my-property-through-a-limited-company-or-as-a-sole-trader-97458.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you own the property through a limited company<\/a>, so make sure you double-check all the deadlines which apply to you!<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more in our guide: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/self-assessment-tax-returns-for-landlords-245905.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Self Assessment for Landlords<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>How much tax will I pay on my earnings from Airbnb?<\/h3>\n<p>Anything you earn over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#personal-allowance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Personal Tax Allowance<\/a> (currently \u00a312,570 for the 2024\/25 tax year) will be subject to tax just like any other type of income, but the good news is that there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/tax-relief-for-the-self-employed-3833.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">other allowances and types of tax relief<\/a> that you might be able to claim to reduce your bill.<\/p>\n<p>This is because the tax that you pay is based on your profits (what&#8217;s left after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/claiming-business-expenses-when-youre-self-employed-34478.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">deducting any costs or expenses<\/a>), rather than the total amount of income.<\/p>\n<h4>Claiming the trading allowance on your tax return<\/h4>\n<p>Remember that \u00a31,000 trading allowance that we mentioned earlier? You might still be able to claim this, even after you register with HMRC. On your tax return you&#8217;ll be given the choice of claiming either the trading allowance or your expenses. <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>If the expenses that you incur as a result of letting out property on Airbnb are less than the \u00a31,000 allowance, it makes more sense to claim the allowance on your tax return, helping to reduce your tax bill by a larger amount.<\/li>\n<li>If your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/claiming-for-business-expenses\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">allowable expenses<\/a> are more than the \u00a31,000 trading allowance, claim those instead!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>The Rent a Room Scheme and Airbnb<\/h3>\n<p>You might have a tax-free allowance separate to your main income if you rent a room on Airbnb. The Rent a Room Scheme can be claimed by anyone who rents out a room in the property they live in. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the room being let is furnished or unfurnished.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">It&#8217;s worth noting that you can&#8217;t claim the Rent a Room Scheme and the trading allowance at the same time for the same income.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nLandlords letting out a room in this way can benefit from a further \u00a37,500 tax-free allowance from this rental income. Obviously, the relief won\u2019t be claimable by all Airbnb hosts, but it\u2019s a valuable tax break for those who want to rent out just one room in their main residence.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>An example of working out the Rent a Room Scheme<\/h4>\n<p>Mark earns \u00a320,000 per year from his main job. As an employee he pays tax at 20% on anything he earns over his personal allowance (currently \u00a312,570). In this case, the amount of income subject to tax is \u00a37,430. His employer deducts the tax each time they pay him.<\/p>\n<p>Mark also rents out a room in his house through Airbnb. Thanks to the Rent a Room Relief scheme, he can make an additional \u00a37,500 maximum income and not need to pay any tax on it.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<h4>How it works for couples<\/h4>\n<p>Couples will often rent out a room in their home on Airbnb together. If this is the case, then the Rent a Room allowance is split equally between them into \u00a33,750 each (as long as the room is inside a joint main residence).<\/p>\n<p>For all other situations, for example if a group of friends own the house, then the Rent a Room relief cannot be claimed. That means tax will be due on the Airbnb income straight away.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 400px;\" title=\"What is the Rent a Room Scheme?\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/What-is-the-Rent-a-Room-Scheme.svg\" alt=\"What is the Rent a Room Scheme?\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>What is Section 24 for landlords?<\/h3>\n<p>Section 24 refers to an update to UK tax laws dealing with the way tax is calculated for landlords. The changes mean landlords can no longer deduct mortgage interest and other costs (such as mortgage arrangement fees) from their rental income before working out their tax liability.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s significant, because deducting allowable expenses from income reduces the amount which is subject to tax, therefore reducing the tax bill.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">It\u2019s worth noting that Section 24 <em>does not apply<\/em> to properties considered to be a Furnished Holiday Let.<\/div>\n<h4>Does my property qualify as a Furnished Holiday Let?<\/h4>\n<p>To answer this question, it\u2019s important to know what a \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/a-tax-guide-for-furnished-holiday-lettings-fhl-176033.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Furnished Holiday Let<\/a>\u2019 actually is in legal terms. To be an FHL, your Airbnb must:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Be located in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area (EEA)<\/li>\n<li>Have enough furniture available for everyday use<\/li>\n<li>Be displayed on the Airbnb website and be available to let for a minimum of 210 days of the year<\/li>\n<li>Be rented out as a commercial let to the public for 105 days per year or more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Do Section 24 tax rules apply to Airbnb?<\/h4>\n<p>Large numbers of Airbnb hosts are avoiding the Section 24 interest relief restriction because their properties are indeed Furnished Holiday Lets as discussed above. Section 24 rules come into force on properties <em>not<\/em> classed as FHLs.<\/p>\n<p>The restriction essentially means that higher rate tax payers can\u2019t claim full relief on their mortgage interest. Many people are finding it makes financial sense to move from traditional long-term letting to Airbnb, due to increased income but less tax.<\/p>\n<h3>What about Capital Gains Tax for Airbnb hosts?<\/h3>\n<p>If your property is a Furnished Holiday Let, and you don\u2019t live there full time yourself, you can claim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/the-basics-of-capital-gains-tax-45500.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Capital Gains Tax<\/a> relief. This may include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>A preferential Capital Gains Tax rate of 10% instead of 24% when the property is sold under the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/what-is-business-asset-disposal-relief-badr-and-can-i-use-it-92397.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Business Asset Disposal Relief scheme<\/a> (previously known as Entrepreneurs\u2019 Relief).<\/li>\n<li>Access to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/the-beginners-guide-to-capital-allowances-127149.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">capital allowances for property fixtures, fittings and furniture<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/gift-holdover-relief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gift Hold-Over Relief<\/a> scheme to avoid paying Capital Gains Tax.
