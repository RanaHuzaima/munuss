They\u2019re often unpaid, and there isn\u2019t always a guaranteed job waiting at the end. Apprenticeships are long-term training programmes that combine on-the-job training with formal education.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"TThe pros of apprenticeships\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/The-pros-of-apprenticeships-and-traineeships.svg\" alt=\"The pros of apprenticeships\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"The cons of apprenticeships\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/The-cons-of-apprenticeships-and-traineeships.svg\" alt=\"The cons of apprenticeships\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Can I get funding if I take on an apprentice?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can normally get help with paying an apprentice during their training, and you might also receive up to \u00a31,000 of additional support too. The funding available depends on whether or not your business is eligible to pay the Apprenticeship Levy.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>If you don\u2019t pay the levy:<\/strong> You\u2019ll pay 5% of the training and assessment costs directly to the training provider.

There are other legal requirements too, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/whats-the-difference-between-the-national-living-wage-and-the-national-minimum-wage-90465.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paying your apprentice the appropriate minimum wage<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The rules for employing an apprentice vary depending on whether you\u2019re an employer based in:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/employing-an-apprentice\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">England<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apprenticeships.scot\/for-employers\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Scotland<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/businesswales.gov.wales\/skillsgateway\/training-support\/apprenticeships\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Wales<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk\/content\/apprenticeships-delivering-work-based-training-and-qualifications-employees\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Northern Ireland<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Identify what your business needs<\/h4>\n<p>Determine the skills and roles within your business that would benefit from a trainee or apprentice. Be clear about the tasks and responsibilities you would like the trainee or apprentice to take on by writing a comprehensive job description.<\/p>\n<h4>Know what training you need to offer<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand the training standards and qualifications needed for the trainee or apprentice role. This may involve collaborating with educational institutions to check it meets with industry standards.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely you will also need to partner with accredited training providers that offer relevant courses or apprenticeship programmes. This can really boost the quality of training and support you offer.<\/p>\n<h4>Create a structured programme<\/h4>\n<p>Develop a structured training programme that combines on-the-job experience with formal learning.

Make sure to outline their working hours, pay, overtime expectations and any additional benefits too. The contract should also include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Details about their probationary period<\/li>\n<li>Notice periods for termination, and the grounds for termination.

It\u2019s a good idea to assign a mentor or supervisor to guide them through their initial weeks, and of course, show them where everything is!<\/p>\n<h4>Plan monitoring and assessment<\/h4>\n<p>Regularly carry out assessments to measure the development of your trainee or apprentice. This feedback is essential for identifying strengths, tackling any problems, and making necessary adjustments to their training programme.<\/p>\n<h4>Build support and mentorship<\/h4>\n<p>Create a positive and inclusive learning environment by providing clear communication, constructive feedback, and plenty of opportunities for hands-on experience. Encourage curiosity and independent thinking, while also offering guidance and mentorship. After all, you want them to feel they can ask any questions without feeling silly!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also useful to design a roadmap for their professional development, setting realistic goals and milestones, and actively involve them in the decision-making process. Ultimately, being patient, approachable and committed to their growth will mean a more rewarding apprenticeship experience.<\/p>\n<h4>Certify completion<\/h4>\n<p>Acknowledge their achievements with a formal certification once they complete their apprenticeship successfully. This not only recognises their efforts, but also adds value to their future career prospects, especially as they can add it to their CV. <\/p>\n<h4>Decide what happens next<\/h4>\n<p>Once the official end date of the apprenticeship is in sight, consider the next steps for the trainee or apprentice. This may involve offering a permanent position within your business, extending their training, or supporting them as they enter the job market.<\/p>\n<p>Now is also a good time to reflect on the overall effectiveness of your traineeship or apprenticeship programme. Consider using this opportunity for feedback from both the trainee and other members of your team to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments for new recruits in the future.
