It could turn out to be a real lifeline, especially for small and independent businesses.<\/p>\n<p>But how do you access the RLS and who\u2019s eligible for financial support? How much could your business get, and what can you use the money for? Let\u2019s take a look at what you need to know about the scheme.<\/p>\n<h3>The Recovery Loan Scheme \u2013 the basics<\/h3>\n<p>Here are all the key points of the scheme in a nutshell:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>It\u2019s available to businesses of all sizes and across most industries.<\/li>\n<li>Originally providing between \u00a325,001 and \u00a310 million per business in loans and overdrafts, from 1st January 2022 the government will guarantee 70% of a loan with a maximum \u00a32 million per business available.<\/li>\n<li>If you receive a loan, you can use the cash for any legitimate business purpose you want.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The Recovery Loan Scheme will be open from <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox-inner\"> 6th April to 30th June 2022.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe RLS will also replace all other existing coronavirus support schemes for UK businesses. This includes the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-support-for-covid-19\/can-i-access-the-coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-51941.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS)<\/a>, Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-support-for-covid-19\/100-government-backed-coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-bounce-back-loan-announced-53433.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If, like other businesses impacted by the pandemic, you\u2019ve been anxious about some of these schemes coming to an end, the announcement of a replacement might be welcome news.<\/p>\n<h4>What does the Recovery Loan Scheme offer?<\/h4>\n<p>The new Recovery Loan Scheme offers a choice of lending solutions to businesses, so you can pick the best arrangement for you.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"30%\"><strong>The Product<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"30%\"><strong>Finance Available<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Terms<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>A term loan or overdraft<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Between \u00a325,001 to \u00a310 million<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Loans will be offered on terms of up to six years, while overdrafts will be up to three years.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Invoice or asset finance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">Between \u00a31,000 and \u00a310 million<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">For invoice finance, terms are up to three years. For asset finance, terms are up to six years.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nAll finance will be made available through a network of approved and accredited lenders. The government has said that it plans to make the full list public as soon as it\u2019s been finalised.<\/p>\n<p>As an incentive to lenders, the government will be guaranteeing up to 80% of the finance. This is to give lenders the confidence to continue to lend to businesses, who otherwise may struggle to access the credit they need.<\/p>\n<h3>Who\u2019s eligible for financial support?<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll be eligible to apply for a loan through the Recovery Loan Scheme if your business:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Trades in the UK.<\/li>\n<li>Has evidence of being affected by the pandemic, such as a demonstrable downturn in income.<\/li>\n<li>Is a viable business \u2013 or would be if not for the impact of COVID-19.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The only business types excluded from the scheme are banks, building societies and insurance companies, for obvious reasons. Also ineligible are state primary and secondary schools, and public sector organisations.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the other COVID support schemes the RLS will replace, there\u2019s no turnover restrictions \u2013 so companies of all sizes can apply.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 480px;\" title=\"Recovery Loan Scheme - Eligibility Checklist\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Recovery-Loan-Scheme-Eligibility-Checklist.svg\" alt=\"Recovery Loan Scheme - Eligibility Checklist\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>Can I apply for the Recovery Loan Scheme if I&#8217;ve used other schemes?<\/h4>\n<p>The good news is that you can still apply for the Recovery Loan Scheme, even if you\u2019ve made use of other coronavirus support schemes.<\/p>\n<h4>Important points about interest, fees and repayments for the RLS<\/h4>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Recovery Loan Scheme won\u2019t be offering free money to businesses. If only.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Unlike other support schemes, RLS fees and interest will not be paid by the British Business Bank.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nYou\u2019ll start paying interest from day one, as well as all of the relevant fees charged by the lender. The exact terms of your repayments, fees, and interest will depend on your individual lending agreement.<\/p>\n<h3>Is the Recovery Loan Scheme as good as previous COVID support schemes?<\/h3>\n<p>As with all things in business, there are pros and cons (such as those below), depending on your specific circumstances.<\/p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s good about the RLS?<\/h4>\n<p>The RLS will offer what are, in many ways, just ordinary business loans. However, with the backing of the UK government and access through a government-controlled scheme, businesses should find it much easier to apply &#8211; and be accepted &#8211; for loans. You can borrow the same large amounts as with CBILS. Crucially, you can also spend the money however you like.<\/p>\n<p>This all makes the scheme especially useful for businesses who are in a less than brilliant financial state following the COVID-19 crisis and its numerous nationwide lockdowns.<\/p>\n<p>So, the RLS is straightforward, easy to understand and quite flexible. The eligibility criteria are far less strict than previous schemes such as the CBILS. Plus, there\u2019s just one loan to repay, rather than loans from multiple support schemes running at once.<\/p>\n<p>The RLS could also be good news for new businesses, as there\u2019s no minimum trading history requirement. But there are of course a few downsides to consider. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>What are the potential drawbacks of the RLS?<\/h4>\n<p>For starters, the government is only guaranteeing 80% of the loans, so lenders could still be quite cautious about lending \u2013 even for small amounts.<\/p>\n<p>RLS lending is also subject to affordability checks. This is both a good and bad thing. Affordability checks can help to reduce fraud, and prevent future defaults from businesses who can\u2019t pay back what they\u2019ve borrowed. But it could also mean that some companies, particularly those in poor financial shape, could be barred from accessing the scheme altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Lenders will be looking for viable businesses to reduce the risk of future defaults, which protects you as much as it does them. As heartbreaking as it might be, you&#8217;ll need to have a think about the viability of your business<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"Recovery Loan Scheme Pros\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Recovery-Loan-Scheme-Pros.svg\" alt=\"Recovery Loan Scheme Pros\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"Recovery Loan Scheme Cons\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Recovery-Loan-Scheme-Cons.svg\" alt=\"Recovery Loan Scheme Cons\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>What else do I need to know?<\/h4>\n<p>Here are a few final pointers worth remembering before you apply for the Recovery Loan Scheme:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>No personal guarantees are required for finance under \u00a3250,000.<\/li>\n<li>You won\u2019t be able to use your home as security for any loans.<\/li>\n<li>If your business has already started collective insolvency proceedings, unfortunately you won\u2019t be eligible to apply.<\/li>\n<li>Credit checks and anti-fraud checks will be carried out on all applicants.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As an applicant you\u2019ll still be subject to the individual lender\u2019s assessment, which could impact the amount you receive under the scheme. However, it\u2019s assumed that when making their decisions, many lenders will be overlooking their concerns about the short-term performance of businesses due to the pandemic.<\/p>\n<h3>How to apply for the Recovery Loans Scheme<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll have to hold tight for just a bit longer to find out how to apply for the RLS. The government is keeping the full details of the scheme under wraps for now, possibly until existing support schemes such as the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) wind down at the end of March 2021.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to stay up to date with the latest news is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/recovery-loan-scheme\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">keep checking back on the UK Government Recovery Loan Scheme page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Making the most of your loan<\/h3>\n<p>Now, we\u2019ve covered all of the details on the Recovery Loan Scheme that are available so far, but there\u2019s one last thing to talk about. How will you use the money?<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019ll know best where your business needs support, and what you\u2019ll need to bounce back after the worst of the pandemic is over.<\/p>\n<p>One of the attractive features of the RLS is that you can use the money for any legitimate business purpose. Before you apply in April 2021, it\u2019s worth putting some serious consideration into how you\u2019ll prioritise your spending.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 600px;\" title=\"Making the most of your loan\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Making-the-most-of-your-loan.svg\" alt=\"Making the most of your loan\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>Use your loan to help tide your business over in the here and now<\/h4>\n<p>For example, helping to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">manage cashflow<\/a> or invest in new equipment or improvements to your premises. You can top up your inventory, make your processes more cost-effective or even take on a new staff member (in which case, you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/new-employers-guide\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">read our guide for employers!<\/a>). <\/p>\n<p>And of course, there may be the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/what-does-brexit-mean-for-vat-and-businesses-70596.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extra costs associated with Brexit<\/a> paperwork to pay for.<\/p>\n<h4>Or how about pivoting to a new, more pandemic-resilient business model?<\/h4>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/how-do-i-start-an-ecommerce-business-online-71939.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">retailers who\u2019ve had success with online selling during lockdown<\/a> may want to invest in making it a permanent part of their business model. You may also want to take steps to future-proof your supply chain against shocks like COVID-19 and Brexit. <\/p>\n<p>This could be a really smart way to spend the money, to insulate your business so that you (fingers crossed) won\u2019t need to access support schemes in the future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Online accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>Get a quote and see how much you could be saving!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Get an instant quote<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Get your long-term plans for growth back on track<\/h4>\n<p>Rather than firefighting or managing day-to-day operations in the short-term, you may instead want to focus on the future. The Recovery Loan Scheme can be used to kickstart plans for growth and expansion that you\u2019ve had to put off due to the pandemic. <\/p>\n<p>You can make serious investments in your business, open new sites, launch a new product line or branch out into whole new markets. With up to \u00a310 million potentially on the table, your options are wide open.<\/p>\n<p>Just make sure you can afford the repayments without putting your business at risk. These are uncertain times, financially speaking. The Recovery Loan Scheme could be super helpful for getting your business back on track, but remember that it is still a loan that will need to be repaid, interest and costs included.<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online accountancy services for businesses<\/a>.
