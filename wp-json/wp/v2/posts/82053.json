This includes all sorts, from general enquiries that clients may have, client registration forms, answering the phone, confirmation statements, share transfers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/vat-return-services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VAT registration forms<\/a>, chasing debtors and helping clients resolve any issues.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing I have to do in the morning is make a coffee! From there I check my emails and deal with any client queries. Then I process any registration forms that have come over from our sales team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and start any company formations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the afternoon I submit confirmation statements that need doing that day, then raise any invoices that the accountants are asking for.<\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>With HMRC always changing I do have to keep up-to-date with any changes and learn new procedures, the latest one being Making Tax Digital. As well as making sure we register clients for MTD in time, these changes alter how we are able to authorise clients.<\/p>\n<p>As we are a busy, fast-paced office, it can be a challenge. We take pride in making sure that everything is always done in a timely manner, and correctly.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>At this time it would definitely have to be COVID, it has affected so many of our clients.<\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I have always worked in customer relationship roles, being approachable, and working with people to help them.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>I love the people I work with! It is such a good team at TAP, and everyone is so friendly and helpful.<\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>Again it would be the people I work with, and also how modern the company is. TAP treat their staff really well and you definitely feel like you are appreciated working here.<\/p>\n<p>They treat us to lunch twice a week, along with staff nights out every quarter (before COVID hit). We have a very modern office which includes a chill out room and other perks like free fruit. I\u2019ve never known a company like it!<\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>I am AAT level 3 trained, so this does help give me a bit more of an understanding. I have always enjoyed working with numbers, which does help massively when raising invoices and working out client fees.<\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit on days off?<\/h3>\n<p>Since being in lockdown I have really taken to walking. The Wirral has some really amazing places to go for a walk, my favourite at the moment being the prom along New Brighton.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 900px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 900\/160;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 900px;\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/get-a-quote-accounting-services-blog-banner.png\" alt=\"instant quotes for online accountancy\" width=\"900\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>It would have to be the standard achievement of my daughter.

I got into them years ago, until my Kindle broke. As I had a new one for Christmas I&#8217;m getting back into the series and started reading them again.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>It would have to be my Dad, he is literally my rock. While I was going through my divorce he stayed with me for a week to get everything sorted while I was in work, so I didn\u2019t have to face the parts of it I didn\u2019t want to.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;ll have to be that classic north-south divide: Is it squash or juice? The one you dilute with water is squash.
