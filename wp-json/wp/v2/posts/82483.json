Once the scheme is underway, business will have the chance to apply via the government\u2019s approved lender network.<\/p>\n<p>Full details on how to apply haven\u2019t yet been made available, so it\u2019s worth checking the government\u2019s Recovery Loan Scheme page regularly.<\/p>\n<h4>And for the self-employed?<\/h4>\n<p>Those who are self-employed may also be eligible for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-support-for-covid-19\/a-simple-guide-to-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme-seiss-grant-50646.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">part 4 (and 5!) of the SEISS grant scheme<\/a>.

For those taking the government up on this, interest started to accrue on the outstanding balance from 1st February 2021.<\/p>\n<p>VAT payments can also be deferred. People taking this route will need to opt-in to the scheme which then means they\u2019re free to make smaller payments over the 2021-22 tax year.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interested to discover more about our range of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\">online accountancy services for low fixed monthly fees<\/a>?
