But how do you pay taxes as an Etsy seller? We\u2019ll take a look at how you can make your business stand out, and what this means for your tax bill<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Top tips for making your Etsy store standout<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/how-do-i-start-an-ecommerce-business-online-71939.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Setting up an ecommerce business<\/a> can be an efficient way to broaden your horizons, helping you to find more customers than you might if you relief entirely on in-person sales.<\/p>\n<p>When you (literally) set up shop <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/paying-tax-when-you-sell-through-online-marketplaces-78286.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">using an online marketplace<\/a> such as Etsy, you\u2019re exposing your brand to the hundreds of thousands of people who go to that website, which is one of the main benefits. But with so many other sellers having the same idea, what can you do to stand out? We have five tips to consider when you\u2019re looking to make your Etsy business a success. <\/p>\n<h4>Build yourself a personal brand<\/h4>\n<p>The current market is pretty crowded, and shoppers have never been so spoilt for choice. Just a click of a button and hundreds of options instantly become available.<\/p>\n<p>Standing out amongst the crowd is tough, but one way you\u2019ll do that is by creating a distinctive brand identity. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>A memorable name<\/li>\n<li>A unique logo<\/li>\n<li>A recurring style of design across your products<\/li>\n<li>Specific fonts and colours that you stick to across your online store and marketing<\/li>\n<li>The tone of voice you use across your product copy, marketing, and customer communications should also reflect the nature of what you offer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The key point in all of these is <em>consistency<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p>Having a consistent brand in place exudes a sense of professionalism \u2013 instilling trust and loyalty in your audience. It also helps customers recognise your business more easily.<\/p>\n<h4>Ensure your customer experience is second to none<\/h4>\n<p>When it comes to e-commerce platforms like Etsy, customer feedback in the form of reviews and ratings can be a huge part of your success. Most people check reviews and customer photos before purchasing a product from you, so providing quality products along with great service gives your customers something to rave about. <\/p>\n<p>Great service is a key component when it comes to customer reviews. People want a smooth buying experience from the <em>moment<\/em> they order to the minute it arrives. This helps you get new customers, and also keep old ones returning. To brush up on your service skills, you could: <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Be as responsive as possible to enquiries, and mark your shop as closed when you\u2019re going to be unavailable so that you don&#8217;t leave people hanging<\/li>\n<li>Timely shipping and deliveries, and keep customers informed of each stage so they know where their order is up to<\/li>\n<li>Use protective packaging so their purchases arrive safely<\/li>\n<li>If possible, offer discount codes to returning customers and thank them again for their order<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Etsy shoppers are also accustomed to finishing touches such as a branded sticker, some colourful tissue paper, a small freebie (where possible), and \u2013 most popular of all \u2013 a personalised thank you note.<\/p>\n<p>This is another point at which brand consistency is key. Once customers associate you with good service and quality, they\u2019ll know to expect this when buying other products from you, too. <\/p>\n<h4>Make sure your content is crystal clear<\/h4>\n<p>When we say content, we\u2019re talking about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/digital-marketing-for-beginners\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the digital marketing media you put online<\/a> like images, articles, and ads. To promote and sell on Etsy your content should include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Well-lit, high-quality photos that showcase your products clearly and in detail<\/li>\n<li>Concise, well-considered product descriptions which leave no questions unanswered<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In short \u2013 what would inspire you to buy? When writing your product information, it\u2019s also important to consider the keywords that your target audience might be searching for. This helps them find your products more easily when shopping.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>For example<\/h4>\n<p>If you sell customised humorous gift cards, include phrases in your product description like: \u2018funny customised birthday card\u2019 and \u2018cards to make someone laugh\u2019. You might have a product name in your head, but unless your audience is also searching for that particular word, they won\u2019t find you. Make sure you cover all angles!\n<\/p><\/div>\n<h4>Review your products on a regular basis<\/h4>\n<p>For some people this might be every week, and for others, every six months. It all depends on the nature of the product and the demands on your time and creative output.<\/p>\n<p>Review your existing products to see what\u2019s popular and make changes such as launching new ones as regularly as you can. It will help keep new and existing customers excited and engaged with your brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure on what you can do to improve your product \u2013 ask your customers for input. Feedback is invaluable to your business and much needed to ensure customers keep coming back for more. It also shows you <em>care<\/em> about what they think, which is a big deal to consumers! <\/p>\n<h4>Use social media marketing to your advantage<\/h4>\n<p>Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and even LinkedIn are all great ways to spread the word about your brand and products.<\/p>\n<p>You might rely on likes and shares from followers to spread the word, perhaps sponsor some posts, or even set up targeted ads. The beauty of advertising on social is <em>low<\/em> <em>cost<\/em>. It\u2019s much cheaper than the old days of paying for ad space in print publications, which means it\u2019s far more accessible. You can also turn it on and off whenever you need to so if something isn&#8217;t working, you can pause the budget and stop spending immediately.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to go further than that, you can do <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/do-influencers-pay-tax-243980.html#do-i-pay-tax-on-gifted-items\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gifted collaborations with influencers<\/a>, or even ask your customers to post their orders online with a chance to feature across your social media. There have been many instances of products going viral thanks to influencer collaborations and customer reviews on the likes of TikTok \u2013 so it\u2019s definitely worth a go!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/amazon-ecommerce-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Ecommerce accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Accounting for eCommerce sellers from \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How much can I earn on Etsy before I need to let HMRC know and pay taxes?<\/h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/can-i-use-the-trading-allowance-57305.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trading allowance (sometimes referred to as your \u2018hobby\u2019 allowance)<\/a> is the same across the board for everything, including Etsy \u2013 meaning you can make \u00a31,000 from self-employment before you need to let HMRC know. <\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 340px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 340\/451;margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"If you earn less than the trading allowance\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Do_I_Need_to_Pay_Tax_on_My_Side-Hustle_Hobby_Business_.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 340px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 340\/451;margin: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 300px;\" title=\"If you earn more than the trading allowance\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Do_I_Need_to_Pay_Tax_on_My_Side-Hustle_Hobby_Business_-1.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Once your self-employed income reaches the \u00a31,000 threshold you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/how-does-a-sole-trader-register-for-self-assessment-14776.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register for Self Assessment<\/a>, although this <em>does not<\/em> mean you\u2019ll pay tax straight away, it all depends on exactly how much you\u2019ve earned in total for that tax year.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/registering-your-childs-etsy-business-and-your-tax-105661.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">registered an Etsy account on behalf of someone else<\/a> (such as your child because they are not yet old enough to sell online according to Etsy&#8217;s terms of service) then as the named account holder, you&#8217;re still responsible for reporting and paying any tax on your Etsy income.<\/p>\n<h5>How much tax you\u2019ll pay on Etsy based on your earnings<\/h5>\n<p>In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland you&#8217;ll pay income tax based on the rates and thresholds shown in the table below.

When your items do begin to sell, you\u2019ll pay a 6.5% transaction fee on your sale price \u2013 this also includes the delivery charge you\u2019ve set for your customers. The good news is that you can normally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/can-i-reclaim-transaction-fees-as-an-expense-166713.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim these transaction fees as an expense<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>There are also additional charges \u2013 for example, if you use Etsy Payments there&#8217;s a 4% fee plus a 20p payment processing fee. <\/p>\n<p>This can feel a little confusing, but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get the hang of it.
