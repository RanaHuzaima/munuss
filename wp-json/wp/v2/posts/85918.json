It certainly sounds like a wonderful thing, but what does it really mean, and how will it impact your business?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not an accountant (or perhaps even if you are!) this is a topic laden with jargon and some pretty complex ideas guaranteed to have a few scratching their heads. Here, we break it down and look at what the super-deduction is, how it works, and who might find it useful.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the super-deduction?<\/h3>\n<p>The super-deduction is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/different-types-of-capital-allowances-127089.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new type of capital allowance<\/a>, which means companies can use it to claim tax relief on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-are-business-assets-86076.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">assets<\/a> which in turn reduces their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/corporation-tax-for-limited-companies\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corporation Tax<\/a>. It\u2019s a temporary measure, available from 1st April 2021 until 31 March 2023. Purchases made from 1st April 2023 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/different-types-of-capital-allowances-127089.html#Full%20expensing%20(FE)\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">might instead be eligible for Full Expensing (FE)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>How do I work out the super-deduction?<\/h4>\n<p>Normally, companies can claim for assets at 100% of their value to get tax relief. So, if a company pays Corporation Tax (charged at a rate of 19%), the tax relief of an asset worth \u00a310,000 is 19% of its full value, meaning the amount of tax relief would be \u00a31,900.  <\/p>\n<p><em>19% of \u00a310,000 = \u00a31,900 of tax relief.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But the super deduction allows you to claim relief on 130% of the asset\u2019s value. This means that for companies who pay Corporation Tax, the tax relief of an asset worth \u00a310,000 would be calculated on 130% of its value. <\/p>\n<p><em>130% of \u00a310,000 = \u00a313,000<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This means companies will get a tax relief of \u00a32,470, because 19% of \u00a313,000 = \u00a32,470<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" width=\"25%\"><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Without the super-deduction<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>With the super-deduction<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Asset value<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">\u00a310,000<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">\u00a310,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Claiming tax relief on<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">100% of the asset&#8217;s value = \u00a310,000<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">130% of the asset&#8217;s value = \u00a313,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Corporation Tax relief (at rate of 19%)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">19% of \u00a310,000 = \u00a31,900<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">19% of \u00a313,000 = \u00a32,470<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This means that the effective tax relief with the super-deduction is 25% because: <\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>19% of 130% of the asset\u2019s value = 25% of 100% of its value.

The hope is these new measures will make Britain&#8217;s capital allowances system more competitive, and drive productivity back up.<\/p>\n<p>Targeting businesses that have managed to save during the pandemic through reduced operating costs and government support, the government is hoping to encourage \u201can investment-led recovery\u201d.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nThese tax incentives are designed to inspire companies to grow their business by making large, productivity-enhancing purchases now. Or as it has also been dubbed, the \u201csplash out to help out\u201d scheme. This would give the UK economy the post-pandemic boost it so desperately needs. <\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/obr.uk\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)<\/a> the super-deduction is set to increase the level of business investment by 10% (around \u00a320 billion a year) at its peak. <\/p>\n<h3>What qualifies as plant and machinery?<\/h3>\n<p>HMRC haven\u2019t released a hard definition of \u201cnew and unused\u201d plant and machinery. However, most tangible assets used during a business\u2019s lifespan are considered plant and machinery for the purposes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/the-beginners-guide-to-capital-allowances-127149.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming capital allowances<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>So, whilst there is not an exhaustive list, qualifying assets can generally be defined as:<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Solar panels<\/li>\n<li>IT equipment and servers<\/li>\n<li>Tractors, lorries, vans<\/li>\n<li>Ladders, tools<\/li>\n<li>Cranes<\/li>\n<li>Office chairs and desks<\/li>\n<li>Electric vehicle charge points<\/li>\n<li>Refrigeration units<\/li>\n<li>Compressors<\/li>\n<li>Foundry equipment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What doesn\u2019t qualify?<\/h3>\n<p>Cars, shares, or residential property do not qualify. You can\u2019t make claims on assets purchased as part of a property unless you acquire the property brand new, and directly from the developer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">You must not have entered the contract to purchase the asset before <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox-inner\">31 March 2021.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nIf you already have an umbrella agreement in place for lots of equipment and you\u2019re drawing down equipment from that, it isn\u2019t covered. Even if you see it as a new purchase, HMRC won\u2019t!<\/p>\n<h4>What about second-hand or buy-to-rent assets?<\/h4>\n<p>The super-deduction only applies to new plant and machinery, not second-hand, nor can you use it for equipment you\u2019re planning to offer for rent. <\/p>\n<p>A machine that has been used for demonstration purposes or testing, such as test-driving a new van before purchase, are still \u2018new and unused\u2019 under HMRC\u2019s definition. <\/p>\n<h4>Hire purchase finance and the super-deduction<\/h4>\n<p>HMRC have also confirmed that the super-deduction is available for equipment purchased via hire purchase finance, though only if ownership of the assets passes to the hirer. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s therefore essential to look at these on a case-by-case basis, and carefully review the agreement documents. <\/p>\n<p>Assets acquired under finance lease type arrangements will continue to be ineligible for capital allowances, including the super-deduction. But remember, there are still other types of allowance that can provide relief for qualifying assets. We&#8217;ll explain those next.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What happens without the super-deduction?<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to claim the super-deduction, but can still choose to claim tax relief on your assets using other schemes.<\/p>\n<h4>The Annual Investment Allowance (AIA)<\/h4>\n<p>AIA, or Annual Investment Allowance to give its full title, allows you to claim the full cost of qualifying assets. <\/p>\n<h5>Claiming AIA<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Claim 100% of the assets\u2019 value.<\/li>\n<li>The allowance available in a year is usually capped at \u00a3200,000.<\/li>\n<li>As part of the COVID economic recovery, the cap has been temporarily increased to \u00a31 million worth of assets. Originally expected to reduce on 31 December 2021, the temporary cap will now stay in place until 1 April 2023. There isn\u2019t a cap on the super-deduction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the asset doesn\u2019t qualify for AIA, then you can look to claim First Year Allowances.<\/p>\n<h4>What are first year allowances for assets?<\/h4>\n<p>Some assets \u2013 such as energy or resource efficient equipment like cars with low CO2 emissions &#8211; qualify for first year allowances (FYA). <\/p>\n<h5>Claiming first year allowances<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Claim 100% of the assets\u2019 value.<\/li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t count towards the AIA limit.<\/li>\n<li>Generally available for expenditure to improve energy efficiency.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>50% first year allowance for special rate assets<\/h5>\n<p>There\u2019s also a new type of first year allowance for special rate assets. The special rate pool essentially covers long-life assets, such as integral features like hot and cold-water systems within a commercial building. <\/p>\n<p>Special rate items are normally only able to claim relief of 6%, but the new (albeit temporary) 50% FYA allows companies to claim (you\u2019ve guessed it) 50% relief on special rate items. <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The 50% first year allowance on special rate assets is available until <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox-inner\"> 31st March 2023.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nAnd finally, we come to writing down allowances.<\/p>\n<h4>What are writing down allowances?<\/h4>\n<p>Basically, the value of your assets reduces over time. Writing down allowances (WDA) allow you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-depreciation-182315.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim against this depreciation<\/a>, which effectively reduces profit and therefore your tax bill. <\/p>\n<h5>Claim writing down allowances<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>If the asset doesn\u2019t qualify for first year allowances.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ve reached the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) limit.<\/li>\n<li>The asset isn\u2019t eligible for AIA.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can claim WDA on any amount above the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA). The items that you claim for are grouped into pools, depending on what they are.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Main pool assets have a rate of 18%:<\/strong> this includes plant and machinery that you use in the business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Special rate pool assets have a rate of 6%:<\/strong> these are long life items, or the integral features of a building.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>When isn\u2019t the super-deduction so super?<\/h3>\n<p>Previously, qualifying assets would be placed in a pool, and written down each year by 18%. However, if you\u2019re now claiming the super-deduction on an asset, you will need to identify each purchase individually to claim the 130% relief.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\n\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Good record keeping<\/a> is essential here! This is because when you come to sell it, you must bring in 130% of the proceeds as a balancing charge. <\/p>\n<p>By then, your Corporation Tax rate might also have risen to 25% in line with the government\u2019s plans to increase it for some companies. This could present a significant unwinding and nasty claw back in subsequent years, so think about the impact of that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on your cash flow<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>You only really get relief on the difference between what you\u2019ve paid and what you get when you sell it. Unless of course you scrap it.<\/p>\n<h4>The rising Corporation Tax rate<\/h4>\n<p>Conveniently the timeframe for the super-deduction sees it finishing the day before the Corporation Tax rate hikes up from 19% to 25% on 1st April 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier in the article we compared the tax relief available with the super-deduction and without it. With the super-deduction, companies can claim for 19% tax relief, on 130% of the asset\u2019s value. <\/p>\n<p>19% x 1.3 = 24.97. Pretty close to 25% wouldn\u2019t you say? <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s basically equivalent to claiming tax relief of 25% on 100% of the asset\u2019s value. Which is exactly what companies will be able to do once the super-deduction ends, and Corporation Tax goes up.Going back to our example manufacturing company:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" width=\"25%\"><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>With <\/em>the super-deduction, <em>before <\/em>Corporation Tax increases<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Without <\/em>the super-deduction, <em>after <\/em>Corporation Tax increases<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Asset value<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">\u00a310,000<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">\u00a310,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Claiming tax relief on<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">130% of the assets value = \u00a313,000<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">100% of the assets value = \u00a310,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Corporation Tax<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">19%<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">25%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\"><strong>Corporation Tax relief<\/strong><\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">19% of \u00a313,000 = \u00a32,470<\/td>\n<td class=\"tg-o4o5\">25% of \u00a310,000 = \u00a32,500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If they invest that \u00a310,000 after Corporation Tax rises in 2023, the tax relief available will only be \u00a330 more than if they invest at the time of the super-deduction.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, you\u2019re getting a first-year tax allowance on the new 25% Corporation Tax rate. Encouraging investment now means companies won\u2019t be able to get both the super-deduction\u2019s 30% enhancement up to 31st March 2023 and tax relief on that expenditure at 25%.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 780px;\" title=\"Infographic about rising Corporation Tax rates\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-rising-corporation-tax-rate.svg\" alt=\"Infographic about rising Corporation Tax rates\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Will I save tax using the super-deduction?<\/h3>\n<p>Overall, this depends on your individual circumstances. Because assets are being treated individually rather than pooled, accelerating your expenditure if you don\u2019t really need to right now &#8211; just to take advantage of the increased rate &#8211; could cost you more.<\/p>\n<p>Lower end investments of \u00a31 million per year or less would be better continuing with their current plans to avoid losing any profit. However, if you have expenditure that creates a loss before the tax rate change and carry that loss forward, and then go on to make a profit, you will see a benefit.<\/p>\n<h3>Invest now or later?<\/h3>\n<p>It is important to analyse the size of the investment against your financial plans and cash flows over the next few years to see if this is a viable option for your business. The size of the investment and the type of assets being purchased also need to be taken into consideration.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, you don&#8217;t have to claim the super-deduction! It&#8217;s optional.<\/p>\n<p>If your company is making a loss, or profits are low, you can assign them to your AIA. Claiming writing down allowances means you can tailor the claim to increase your taxable losses. For example:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Your company loses \u00a360,000 in a year.<\/li>\n<li>You have AIA qualifying expenditure of \u00a3100,000 in a year.<\/li>\n<li>You can add these together, which will increase your taxable losses to \u00a3160,000.<\/li>\n<li>Carry those losses into the next year and if you made \u00a3100,000 you can use the previous year\u2019s \u00a3100,000 of qualifying expenditure to \u201cnull\u201d your profit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you run a limited company, it would basically mean that no Corporation Tax would be due.<br \/>\n\u2003<\/p>\n<h3>Where accountants can help<\/h3>\n<p>Your accountant will be (or should be!) well acquainted with your business plans and financial positioning. They\u2019ll advise you on what capital allowances are available, including the super-deduction. An accountant will also understand how they can work together, and show you estimates for tax cash flows to see how it impacts the timings of any potential investment plans.<\/p>\n<p>Crucially, they will help ensure you keep detailed records in order to know what expenditure you\u2019re claiming against which allowance. This will become incredibly important when the time comes to sell your assets to prevent any headaches!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Online accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>Get a quote and see how much you could be saving!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Get an instant quote<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Invest wisely<\/h3>\n<p>While this may seem like a tax giveaway, buyers beware!
