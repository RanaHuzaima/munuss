The EU is rolling out further rule changes from 1st July 2021 which will change VAT for ecommerce sellers and online marketplaces in any country who sell directly to EU consumers.<\/p>\n<h3>Who is affected by the new EU VAT rules for e-commerce?<\/h3>\n<p>If you sell or supply goods and services to EU consumers who aren\u2019t VAT registered then yes, the changes might affect you. It\u2019s important to note there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/explainers-53724381\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">special arrangements for Northern Ireland<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These arrangements have an impact on what the rules mean for you depending on whether your business is in Northern Ireland, or in Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland). We\u2019ll go through the new e-commerce VAT rules in more detail, and how the changes might affect your business on the basis of location.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>The new EU distance selling rules for VAT<\/h3>\n<p>Like the name suggests, distance selling means that you are, literally, selling at a distance, rather than in-person in a shop. Under the previous rules, sellers could make distance sales to consumers in other EU countries without needing to register for VAT there, until they reached the distance selling threshold for that country. Once they reached the distance selling threshold for that country, they would need to register for VAT there.<\/p>\n<p>When the new rules kick in on 1st July 2021 the distance selling thresholds for each EU state will be replaced with one universal threshold.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The new universal distance-selling threshold is <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox-inner\"> \u20ac10,000<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The new rules take all EU distance sales into account, rather than operating a country-by-country basis.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li><strong>Before 1st July 2021:<\/strong> You might reach the distance sales threshold in one country, but not in another. You can register for VAT in one country, but continue selling into others under distance selling rules.<\/li>\n<li><strong>From 1st July 2021 onwards:<\/strong> You\u2019ll take the total of your cross-border distance sales into consideration. Once the total of your distance sales hits the threshold, you\u2019ll need to start registering for VAT in other EU countries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, though, that British businesses (in Wales, Scotland, and England) are no longer covered by distance selling rules, but those in Northern Ireland are.<\/p>\n<h3>The new EU One-Stop Shop (OSS) for VAT<\/h3>\n<p>The changes to the distance selling rules tie into the new One-Stop Shop (OSS) for VAT. The OSS is an optional system which aims to make it easier for businesses to report the VAT collected on distance sales.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re in the EU or in Northern Ireland<\/strong>, you can register for the OSS alongside your normal VAT return. You\u2019ll be able to continue using the OSS to report your distance sales until you hit that \u20ac10,000 threshold, at which point you must register for VAT in the country that you\u2019re selling to.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that this only applies to EU and NI businesses though! If you\u2019re in Great Britain (that\u2019s England, Wales, or Scotland) then reporting distance sales through the OSS or through your UK VAT return is no longer an option. Instead, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/importing-and-exporting\/how-do-i-export-from-the-uk-1790.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">your sales will be classed as exports<\/a> or fall into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-news\/brexit\/digital-services\/vat-on-cross-border-services-and-digital-sales-after-brexit-75904.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cross-border services and digital sales<\/a> category.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Check out our article about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/vat\/what-does-brexit-mean-for-vat-and-businesses-70596.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EU VAT rules for British businesses after Brexit<\/a> for more information.<\/div>\n<h3>The end of Low-Value Consignment Relief (LVCR) in the EU<\/h3>\n<p>The Low-Value Consignment Relief allowed sellers to import goods for EU consumers without paying import VAT, as long as they were valued at \u20ac22 or less. The UK stopped using the LCVR for imports when the Brexit transition period ended on 31st December 2020.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">LVCR will stop for all countries from 1st July 2021.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nSo, VAT now needs paying on everything, but there are changes for whose responsibility it is to collect the VAT. The process for doing so depends on the value of the shipment, and whether the buyer is a consumer or a business. Sellers and online marketplaces can collect import VAT on consignments worth less than \u20ac150.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Collecting the import VAT\u2019 means you\u2019ll charge VAT on the sale using the rate of import VAT in the customers\u2019 country. But what do you do once you collect it? And who actually collects it?<\/p>\n<h3>The Introduction of the Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS)<\/h3>\n<p>Sellers and online marketplaces in the EU and NI can sell to an EU consumer, and collect the VAT on shipments worth less than \u20ac150. <\/p>\n<p>Rather than registering for VAT in the buyer\u2019s country, and then reporting the VAT there, the seller can register for the new Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS) in their own country, alongside their existing VAT registration. They can then submit an IOSS return to report the import VAT that they collect, and do this alongside their regular VAT return.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/amazon-ecommerce-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Ecommerce accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Accounting for eCommerce sellers from \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Can I register for IOSS in Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland)?<\/h4>\n<p>British sellers are the same as other non-EU sellers now. You\u2019ll be able to register for IOSS, but you won\u2019t be able to register for it in the UK \u2013 that&#8217;s only available to businesses in Northern Ireland. <\/p>\n<p>A British business can only register for IOSS in an EU country, and to do that you must register for VAT there. And that means appointing a VAT fiscal representative, and so on. That is, if it\u2019s actually your responsibility to collect it, which we\u2019ll cover next.<\/p>\n<h3>VAT on cross border sales through online marketplaces<\/h3>\n<p>The EU is introducing rules which change the way import VAT on purchases made <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ecommerce\/paying-tax-when-you-sell-through-online-marketplaces-78286.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">through an online marketplace<\/a> is dealt with.<\/p>\n<p>From 1st July 2021, an EU or NI customer buying through an online marketplace pays the import VAT at the point of sale. The marketplace will collect the VAT, making them responsible for the appropriate VAT registration, not the seller. The UK already has these rules in place for British customers, following the end of the Brexit transition period.<\/p>\n<p>That just leaves the seller to think about what VAT might do to their sale price. Do they simply add VAT at the checkout, or include it in the existing price (which will chomp into their profit margin)?
