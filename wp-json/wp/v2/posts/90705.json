To help you manage the legal requirements of paying yourself from your business, we\u2019ll explain how often you can take dividends, and what the process is for paying them.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a dividend?<\/h3>\n<p>Dividends are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/what-are-dividends-1696.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payments which a company makes to its shareholders out of its profits<\/a>. These profits are essentially what is left over in the business once all taxes, expenses and liabilities have been paid. Also called \u2018retained profit\u2019, this left over money may accumulate over time. Watch our short video below about paying yourself from your limited company using dividends.

Dividends are paid from a company&#8217;s profits, so payments might fluctuate depending on how much profit is available. <strong>If the company doesn&#8217;t have any retained profit, it can&#8217;t make dividend payments.<\/strong> Doing so will likely to see you end up in hot water with HMRC, with penalties to pay!<\/p>\n<p>Before you pay yourself or your shareholders a dividend, it&#8217;s important you make sure there\u2019s enough money in the company to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-is-cash-flow-in-business-60140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cover day-to-day cash flow<\/a>.

Most businesses distribute them quarterly or every six months, after working out what profits are left over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/year-end-accounting-for-limited-companies-234079.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at the end of the year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>The timing of dividend payments may affect how much tax you pay<\/h4>\n<p>For many businesses, profits can vary dramatically from one year to the next. In a particularly profitable year, you might take a tactical approach to paying dividends to pad out leaner times. This can also produce a more even income pattern, which makes personal financial planning less stressful, and can even help you avoid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-is-the-40-tax-bracket-233267.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paying a higher tax rate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if your company generates profits of \u00a350,000 in Year 1, and \u00a310,000 in Year 2, the total profits over two years will be \u00a360,000. Rather than paying a large dividend one year, and a small one the next, you might decide to declare dividends of \u00a330,000 per year. <\/p>\n<p>This means you&#8217;ll have a more regular income, and if all your income is from these dividend payments, you&#8217;ll be under <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#income-tax\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the threshold for basic rate tax<\/a> in each year.<\/p>\n<h4>When do I pay tax on dividend payments?<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike a salary, dividends aren&#8217;t taxed at source, so you&#8217;ll need to declare them as part of your Self Assessment tax return. Any tax you owe for dividends normally needs paying to HMRC by the January following the end of the tax year during which the dividend was paid. <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">A tax year always starts 6th April, and ends 5th April.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nSo, if a dividend was paid in late March 2024 for example, the tax on it is due in January 2025. A dividend paid in May 2024 falls into the following tax year, so the tax won\u2019t need paying until January 2025 (though you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/how-soon-should-i-submit-my-2021-22-self-assessment-tax-return-51193.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit your tax return earlier<\/a> than that!).<\/p>\n<h3>Who needs to pay dividend tax?<\/h3>\n<p>Dividends come from the company&#8217;s after-tax profit, so it doesn&#8217;t pay tax in respect of any dividend payments it makes. The shareholders that receive a dividend will normally need to declare it on their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Self Assessment tax return,<\/a> and pay tax accordingly.

The most tax efficient salary for a company director depends on how many of you there are in the business, and other income you might receive.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-most-tax-efficient-directors-salary-in-2022_23-51622.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article about director&#8217;s salaries<\/a> explains how this works, and what the rates and thresholds are for this year.<\/div>\n<h4>What about the tax-free Dividend Allowance?<\/h4>\n<p>The dividend allowance is the amount of dividends you can receive in a year before starting to pay tax on them. You can use it alongside your personal tax allowance (which can also be used against your dividend income). In the 2023\/24 tax year the dividend allowance was \u00a31,000, but this reduces in 2024\/25.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The 2024\/25 dividend allowance is <\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox-inner\">\u00a3500<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>How much is dividend tax?<\/h3>\n<p>The rate of tax you pay on dividends depends on your tax band (called your \u2018marginal rate\u2019). For example, if your total income for the year means that you&#8217;re a basic rate taxpayer, then you&#8217;ll pay the Dividend Basic Rate. We explain the rates and thresholds in more detail <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/paying-tax-on-dividends-in-2022-23-56115.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in our guide to paying tax on dividends<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>What are the dividend tax rates and thresholds for the 2024\/25 tax year?<\/h4>\n<p>The rates for dividend tax aren\u2019t as high as income tax rates, which is what makes dividends so tax-efficient. The table below shows the dividend tax rates in force for 2023\/24 (6th April 2023 &#8211; 5th April 2024) and 2024\/25 (6th April 2024 &#8211; 5th April 2025).

If you can&#8217;t prove that money you receive from your business is a dividend, HMRC may consider it a salary payment &#8211; and tax it accordingly. The rate of income tax is higher than the dividend tax rate, so it can end up being an expensive mistake, especially if you also land <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/dealing-with-tax-return-penalties-3571.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a penalty to go with it<\/a>!
