They essentially do the same thing, but the confirmation statement is quicker and easier to file.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the purpose of a confirmation statement?<\/h3>\n<p>Limited companies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) submit confirmation statements to make sure that their details at Companies House are correct and up to date. It\u2019s not meant to be a way of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/file-changes-to-a-company-with-companies-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reporting any changes in your company<\/a> (which is a separate process). In essence, the confirmation statement is just that \u2013 it\u2019s a statement which confirms the information is accurate.<\/p>\n<p>Your confirmation statement must also include an email address which Companies House will use to contact you (although your email will not be shared on the public register).<\/p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s the difference between an annual return and a confirmation statement?<\/h4>\n<p>Confirmation statements have actually replaced the old-style annual return, though they do pretty much the same job. The newer confirmation statement also includes space to record information about \u2018People with Significant Control\u2019 (PSCs). This information identifies the people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-difference-between-a-shareholder-and-a-director-40226.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">involved in the management and ownership of a company<\/a>, and will be made publicly available on the Companies House register.<\/p>\n<h4>Registering a Person with Significant Control<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s essential that this information is reviewed regularly and always kept up to date, including:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The person\u2019s name<\/li>\n<li>Month and year of birth<\/li>\n<li>Nationality<\/li>\n<li>Country of residence<\/li>\n<li>Service and residential addresses<\/li>\n<li>The date they took a position of significant control with the company.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is also important to explain their position and standing in the organisation, and outline why they should be included as a Person with Significant Control (PSC).<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Do all businesses need to complete a confirmation statement?<\/h3>\n<p>All UK limited companies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) must file a confirmation statement <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dormant-company\/dormant-companies-explained-8202.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">even if the company or partnership is dormant<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>When is my confirmation statement due?<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to submit a confirmation statement to Companies House at least once every 12 months, but filing can take place any time during your review period. <\/p>\n<p>The review period for new companies that haven\u2019t filed a confirmation statement before begins <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/how-to-register-as-a-limited-company-in-the-uk-60721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at the company\u2019s incorporation date<\/a> and finishes 12 months later.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">If a company is incorporated on 1st January, the review period ends on 31st December.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor more established companies that have already filed at least one confirmation statement before, the review period begins the day after your last confirmation statement was submitted and then ends 12 months later. You can send your confirmation statement early if you want to, which resets the clock so the review period ends 12 months afterwards.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/key-accounting-and-tax-year-dates#What%20tax%20year%20dates%20are%20important%20for%20limited%20companies?\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">key reporting dates for your limited company<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>What if I don\u2019t have any changes to report?<\/h4>\n<p>If nothing has changed since your last confirmation statement, then you don\u2019t need to submit anything new and can simply \u2018check and confirm\u2019 the existing information held on public record.<\/p>\n<h4>What if my confirmation statement is filed late?<\/h4>\n<p>You must file your confirmation statement within 14 days of your review period ending. Don\u2019t risk prosecution or being stuck off the register &#8211; file on time!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about missing the deadline to file your confirmation statement, it\u2019s worth signing up for the Companies House email reminder service. It\u2019s free to use and up to four people can receive a reminder. To make it even easier, you can also submit your statement using the link contained in the email. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/register-for-email-reminders-from-companies-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sign up here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How do I submit a confirmation statement?<\/h3>\n<p>The Companies House online service is the quickest and easiest way to complete your confirmation statement. Using this method also means that most of the information on the form will be pre-populated, so you only need to check the details and edit any changes, rather than start from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to update any of the information Companies House holds for your company, you can do this in the \u2018additional information\u2019 section of the form online. It can be used for updating your:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code<\/li>\n<li>Trading status of shares<\/li>\n<li>Shareholder information<\/li>\n<li>Statement of capital<\/li>\n<li>Exemption from having to keep a register of People with Significant Control<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you need to check the information that Companies House already has about your company, you can do so using the <a href=\"https:\/\/find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Companies House service.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Is there a fee for filing a confirmation statement?<\/h3>\n<p>It costs \u00a313 to file a confirmation statement online in any 12-month period. You\u2019ll only ever pay the \u00a313 fee once in a year, so filing another one in the same period won&#8217;t result in an extra charge. If you do decide to file a paper submission, the charge jumps to \u00a340. It\u2019s also more laborious without any of it being pre-populated &#8211; plus the trip to the post box!<\/p>\n<h3>Who is responsible for completing the confirmation statement?<\/h3>\n<p>Larger or publicly owned companies often have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/difference-between-director-and-secretary-3796.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a company secretary<\/a> who will file the confirmation statement on the company\u2019s behalf. <\/p>\n<p>If your company doesn&#8217;t have a secretary then any of the directors or another designated company member can file it instead. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/llp-limited-liability-partnership\/setting-up-and-running-an-llp-107283.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) you&#8217;ll normally have a &#8216;nominated partner&#8217;<\/a> who takes care of the paperwork, but all of the partners share responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing is that the statement is filed with Companies House on time every year.

There are serious consequences for directors, including fines and prosecution, if it\u2019s not done. Failure to submit the statement on time might also cause the registrar to remove it from the company register. Remember, your accountant may file on your behalf &#8211; but it\u2019s still ultimately your responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>If you need guidance on any aspect of your company\u2019s confirmation statement, we\u2019re here to help!
