This was previously known as Entrepreneurs Relief (ER). In this article we explain what Business Asset Disposal Relief is, how it works, and what it means for Capital Gains Tax.<\/p>\n<h3>What is Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR)?<\/h3>\n<p>To understand BADR, we need to start with Capital Gains Tax (CGT, and yes, accounting is overflowing with acronyms). We explain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/the-basics-of-capital-gains-tax-45500.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Capital Gains Tax<\/a>  in more detail in a separate article, but it\u2019s essentially a tax that you pay on any profits that you make when you dispose of an asset. That profit is a \u2018gain\u2019, so CGT is a tax on the gain that you make.<\/p>\n<h4>What does disposal of an asset mean?<\/h4>\n<p>The term &#8216;disposal&#8217; can be misleading as it doesn&#8217;t always mean the asset is sold. Disposing of a business asset can also mean giving it away, or swapping it for something. It might also mean:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>That you\u2019re disposing of part or all of a business or shares at the end of ownership, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/how-do-i-close-a-limited-company-13628.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">closing a limited company<\/a><\/li>\n<li>The asset has been stolen or damaged, and you\u2019ve been compensated for its loss, such as with an insurance payout<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Only certain asset disposals qualify for BADR where the asset in question is either the entire business, part of the business, or shares.<\/div>\n<h3>Can I claim BADR?<\/h3>\n<p>Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) is only available to individuals operating a business and disposing of a business asset. This disposal may be the sale of an entire business, or the sale of shares. The types of business where BADR applies include the following:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Sole trader<\/li>\n<li>Partnership<\/li>\n<li>Personal company<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/is-a-joint-venture-the-same-as-a-partnership-15309.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joint ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Trust<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How much Capital Gains Tax do I pay if I claim BADR?<\/h3>\n<p>With BADR, individuals pay Capital Gains Tax at a rate of 10% on any gains they make when disposing of qualifying business assets. It\u2019s a significant reduction for higher rate taxpayers, where the rate of CGT will be halved from 20%, to just 10%.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 780px;\" title=\"Capital Gains Tax Rates\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Capital_Gains_Tax_Rates-with-BADR-2024-25.svg\" alt=\"Capital Gains Tax Rates with BADR 2024\/25\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Are there any restrictions on the use of Business Asset Disposal Relief?<\/h3>\n<p>BADR is only available to individuals who own their business or shares in a company. It doesn\u2019t apply to companies in general, so a company can\u2019t apply for relief using BADR.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, it only applies to the qualified disposals of assets from the business. BADR cannot be used to dispose of investment assets, and can only be used by trading businesses.<\/p>\n<h4>The lifetime allowance for Business Asset Disposal Relief<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that you can only claim BADR up to a lifetime limit, which is currently set to \u00a31 million.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The lifetime limit of \u00a31 million doesn\u2019t affect how many times an individual can apply for and use BADR.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nRecord any claims that you make, and refer to this information to make sure you don&#8217;t exceed the lifetime limit. If you <em>do<\/em> reach the \u00a31 million limit then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/uk-tax-rates-thresholds-and-allowances-for-employers-and-the-self-employed-in-2021-22-and-2020-21-2-2-2-51801.html#capital-gains-tax-cgt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CGT will apply at the regular rate<\/a>.

For example, if you completed a business disposal on 15 May 2023, then the disposal took place in the 2023\/24 tax year (6th April 2023 &#8211; 5th April 2024). You have until 31st January 2025 to claim BADR.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the eligibility criteria to be able to claim BADR relief?<\/h3>\n<p>To be eligible to claim BADR, you&#8217;ll need to meet the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The company or business must be trading<\/li>\n<li>A sole trader or partnership must have been trading for at least two years before selling or business ceasing<\/li>\n<li>You own at least 5% of the total shares and voting rights, and have done so for at least two years<\/li>\n<li>Shareholders must have been employees or &#8216;office holders&#8217; (such as a director) for at least two years before the sale<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>An individual selling their entire business or part of their business<\/h4>\n<p>There are two conditions required by which individuals could qualify for BADR if they\u2019re selling all or part of their business:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The individual is a sole trader or business partner<\/li>\n<li>The individual has owned the business for a minimum of two years<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Individuals must ensure the two-year minimum is met before selling their business. This timeframe is known as the &#8216;qualifying period&#8217;. If someone is closing their business, then the same conditions apply but BADR will only be available when the business asset is sold within three years of the business closing.<\/p>\n<h4>An individual is selling shares or securities<\/h4>\n<p>People with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-employment-related-securities-58469.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shares or securities in the company they work for<\/a> can use this relief when they sell them.

However, these claims can be more complicated depending on the circumstances of the trustees, trust and beneficiaries. Qualifying criteria are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>For three years before shares are sold, an individual should be classed as a qualifying beneficiary (QB) for either one year before 6 April 2019 or for two years after this date.<\/li>\n<li>The company of the shares being sold must be the &#8216;personal company&#8217; of the qualifying beneficiary<\/li>\n<li>An individual must be an officer or employee of the company<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You might find it useful to seek further advice on your particular circumstances when seeking BADR as a trustee.<\/p>\n<h4>An individual that is selling the assets that were loaned to their business<\/h4>\n<p>Different criteria are needed for individuals looking to sell their assets that were loaned to their business. This category requires the following conditions:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>An individual that sells a minimum of 5% of their part from the partnership or shares from a personal company<\/li>\n<li>An individual who owns assets that were used by the personal company or their business partner for a minimum of one year<\/li>\n<li>This year must conclude with the individual selling their shares, the business or the business closing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an individual looking to sell assets that were loaned to your business, it&#8217;s a good idea to determine if the assets qualify for BADR in this category.<\/p>\n<h3>How does BADR work with other schemes like Capital Allowances, VAT, and Income Tax relief?<\/h3>\n<p>BADR is about giving relief for capital gains only. Other schemes, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/tax-relief\/capital-allowances\/the-beginners-guide-to-capital-allowances-127149.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">capital allowances<\/a>, VAT, and income tax relief will continue to work the same way they usually do. BADR doesn\u2019t impact these schemes in any way.<\/p>\n<h3>Are there any alternatives to BADR?<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the size of the business asset being disposed of, other schemes may be worth considering due to the \u00a31 million lifetime limit of BADR. These schemes include Investors&#8217; Relief, (Seed) Enterprise Investment Schemes, and Employee Ownership Trusts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online accounting services<\/a>, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">support for tax returns to help you claim tax relief<\/a> you\u2019re entitled to.
