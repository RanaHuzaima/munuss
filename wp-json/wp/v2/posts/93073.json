He explains his role as a Sales Executive here at The Accountancy Partnership.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your job title?<\/h3>\n<p>Sales Executive.<\/p>\n<h3>Give an overview of the duties, functions, and responsibilities of your job.<\/h3>\n<p>I bring onboard new clients! A summary would be that I provide quotes to potential new clients and explain our services and fees to them so they can make an informed decision. Some people aren\u2019t sure what they need, so we ask lots of questions too. And I tell them how great we are! <\/p>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s generally quite fast-paced. There is a lot to manage, and we answer a lot of questions which come in from different sources. We\u2019re on the phones a lot, and on the live chat facility on our website, as well as keeping up to date with our own reports. There\u2019s a lot to keep you busy, which is good in this job. Busy is good.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/quotation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1350px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1350\/240;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 900px;\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/get-a-quote-blog-banner.png\" alt=\"instant quotes for online accountancy\" width=\"900\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>There are a few. We sometimes speak to people who are completely against the idea of using an online based accountancy service, but we usually find this is because they don\u2019t really know what to expect. <\/p>\n<p>They may have been with their previous local accountant for many years and fear the change, even though a lot of the time they haven\u2019t actually seen their accountant in-person for a long time! I take the time to reassure potential clients that our service is reliable and professional, as well as cost effective. We want people to feel comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>I find that if you are clear and honest, then clients are much more likely to understand and embrace the process. Transparency is key.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>The most satisfying part of the job is seeing hard work pay off! Everyone wins in my eyes. When a new client joins us it\u2019s obviously great for us to continue growing as a business, and also means the client almost always reduces their previous accounting fees without sacrificing the level of service. <\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>Genuinely, it\u2019s a great place to come to work. There\u2019s plenty of staff perks with our work lunches, games room, on-site gym and I always enjoy getting involved in our weekly football matches. The thing I\u2019m probably most appreciative of is that you feel TAP are actively helping you in terms of your own health\/diet\/exercise and general well-being. <\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>Adaptability. Every client I speak to is different. So, I have to be ready to deal with all kinds of people and situations. Some can be easy-going and others not so easy! Even just the smallest thing, like laughing at a joke or asking a few more questions can be the difference which helps someone feel relaxed enough to talk about their requirements. <\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit during time off?<\/h3>\n<p>For a holiday it would be Spain. Me and my girlfriend love getting away for a few weeks out there. But during COVID times, we have done a few more staycations. We recently went to the Lakes and had another trip down to London. So I might staycation a bit more in future because we really enjoyed it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1200px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1200\/628;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 1200px;border-radius: 30px;\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Daniel-Ryan-Staff-Spotlight-TAP-Quote.png\" width=\"1200\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>I scored a goal at Anfield once, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6huMUXHExl0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which you can watch on YouTube!<\/a>  My family were in the stands watching too, so it meant a lot. Especially as we are all Liverpool fans.<\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>Probably quite quiet actually. I do a lot of talking on the phone, so I try to keep it balanced so people aren\u2019t sick of hearing my voice all the time! <\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve actually just finished reading Eddie Hearn\u2019s book, \u201cRelentless\u201d. I\u2019m not a big reader but I enjoy his interviews and how passionately he talks about the sport of Boxing. And he\u2019s basically just a glorified salesman, which is what I do, so there was a few useful tips in there!<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you admire, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s so many. Most recently I watched a documentary on Robin Williams, the actor\/comedian, so I\u2019ll say him because of his innate ability to make people of all ages laugh.<\/p>\n<h3>What question would you really like to answer, and what\u2019s the answer?!<\/h3>\n<p>Is it called a Batch\/Cob\/Barm\/Bun\/Bap etc\u2026.? It\u2019s called a bread roll and we all know it.<\/p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the services we offer by hitting the live chat button, or <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant quote online<\/a>.
