In this article we explain how IR35 works, and who is responsible for checking whether a contract is within IR35 rules.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the IR35 rules?<\/h3>\n<p>IR35 legislation deals with contractors who would otherwise be employees if they weren\u2019t working through an \u2018intermediary\u2019. The intermediary could be the contractor\u2019s own limited company, or a partnership. If a contractor is essentially working as an employee in all but name, then the contract is \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/ir35-for-contractors\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">within IR35<\/a>\u2019.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/O2wMl3c4T6I?si=Dv6Vi2I8K9LOwNtR\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h4>Why does it matter?<\/h4>\n<p>If a contract is within IR35, it means that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/ir35\/what-is-ir35-and-does-it-affect-me-135048.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the IR35 rules apply<\/a>, and so the end client who pays the contractor&#8217;s bill must first deduct income tax and National Insurance before paying them &#8211; just like an employer would for a regular employee.<\/p>\n<div class=\"examplebox\">\n<h4>Jargon buster<\/h4>\n<p><strong>What is a personal service company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The phrase \u2018personal service company\u2019 describes limited companies set up purely to act as an intermediary, because they exist for the contractor to provide services to clients.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<h4>How would it work without IR35?<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit confusing, so we\u2019ll give you an example. Imagine you work for an employer, and then leave to set up your own limited company.<\/p>\n<p>You continue performing the same function for your former employer (basically doing the same job), except now you work through your own business, rather than being on their payroll. Without IR35:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The employer effectively has the same employee back, but doesn\u2019t have to pay employer\u2019s NI, pension contributions, sick pay\u2026 and so on. It\u2019s cheaper for them, but means the worker loses the benefit of those contributions, so IR35 protects employees from being forced into this arrangement.<\/li>\n<li>The contractor gets paid by invoicing the business, so won\u2019t have income tax or NI deducted by their employer. The contractor can then pay themselves from their company, using a more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-most-tax-efficient-directors-salary-in-2022_23-51622.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax efficient combination of salary and dividend payments<\/a>. IR35 legislation closes this loophole.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Who decides whether IR35 rules apply or not?<\/h3>\n<p>The off-payroll working rules deal with whose responsibility it is to check if IR35 rules apply in a particular situation, also known as \u2018determining someone\u2019s employment status for IR35\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>These rules mean that the end client is responsible for checking whether a contract is within IR35, <strong>but <\/strong>only if the end client is a public authority or a private company which meets two or more of these conditions:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>It has an annual turnover of more than \u00a310.2 million<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/balance-sheet-58501.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">balance sheet<\/a> total is more than \u00a35.1 million<\/li>\n<li>The client has more than 50 employees on average in an accounting year<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 660px;\" title=\"When do the off-payroll rules apply?\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/When-do-the-off-payroll-rules-apply.svg\" alt=\"When do the off-payroll rules apply?\" alt=\"infographic explaining when the off-payroll rules apply\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>Issuing a Status Determination Statement (SDS)<\/h4>\n<p>If the client meets the criteria, it\u2019s up to them to determine the worker\u2019s status. They\u2019ll issue a Status Determination Statement (SDS) which indicates why the engagement is within (or outside) IR35. The SDS is given to the worker, as well as to any person or organisation the client contracts with.<\/p>\n<h4>What if the client doesn\u2019t fit those criteria?<\/h4>\n<p>If the client doesn\u2019t meet the off-payroll criteria (so they\u2019re a small, private company, or they\u2019re based abroad with no UK connection) then it\u2019s the intermediary\u2019s responsibility to decide whether or not the contract falls within IR35 rules.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>HMRC have an online tool to assist with this, known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check Employment Status for Tax (CEST) tool<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If CEST is used to determine the employment status of an engagement, HMRC will honour the outcome as long as the correct information has been entered.

They\u2019ll pay these to HMRC on behalf of the worker (like they do for employees), as well as making Class 1 employer\u2019s NICs.<\/p>\n<p>In some circumstances the client still pays the gross amount (so they don\u2019t deduct tax or NI), and the intermediary\u2019s payroll makes the deductions instead, with the worker themselves then paid as if they\u2019re employed.<\/p>\n<h3>Can contractors still operate through a limited company?<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no rule to say that you must close your limited company if you\u2019re a contractor, but if your contract does fall within IR35, your client will deduct tax and NI at source.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, you might decide to:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Become an employee, rather than working as a contractor for a client<\/li>\n<li>Use an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/contractors\/umbrella-companies-for-self-employed-contractors-130832.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">umbrella company<\/a> (which we explain further on)<\/li>\n<li>Become a sole trader, and stay outside of IR35 entirely, both for tax and NI reasons, and to avoid the complexity of IR35 itself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Is it better for me to be employed by my client instead?<\/h4>\n<p>Becoming an employee may be good for contractors already treated as inside IR35 when working for a client, but it\u2019s not for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>If the contractor does decide to become an employee, IR35 will no longer be an issue, with income taxes and NICs deducted by the employer at source. Employees also have additional employment rights, including:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Statutory pay, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/employer\/employers-guide-to-statutory-sick-pay-3857.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statutory Sick Pay<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Statutory leave, such as Statutory Maternity Leave<\/li>\n<li>Minimum notice periods and protection against unfair dismissal<\/li>\n<li>Statutory redundancy pay, though this may require a minimum period of continuous employment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The flipside of this is the loss of flexibility, non-competition clauses in employment contracts, and that some businesses may simply prefer not to be an employer.<\/p>\n<h4>What about an Umbrella Company?<\/h4>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/contractors\/umbrella-companies-for-self-employed-contractors-130832.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Umbrella Company<\/a> acts as the contractor\u2019s employer on behalf of an employment agency, operating PAYE and making the appropriate deductions.<\/p>\n<p>They can also offer full employment rights and benefits, and the contractor will pay the umbrella a fee for its services. However, not all umbrella companies are compliant, and as a result some companies won\u2019t work with them.<\/p>\n<h4>Becoming a sole trader instead<\/h4>\n<p>If the sort of work you do will usually be considered to fall within IR35, it might be more tax efficient for you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/sole-trader-guide\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">operate as a sole trader<\/a>, instead. This is because sole traders aren\u2019t legally separate from their business in the way that a director is with their limited company.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogbox\">Read our article which explains <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-start-ups\/should-i-register-myself-as-a-sole-trader-or-a-limited-company-45326.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the difference between sole traders and limited companies<\/a> in more detail.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nAs a result, it means they pay tax and NI on all their profits, rather than on the money they pay themselves from the business. This means the loophole which IR35 closes isn\u2019t available to sole traders anyway, so they aren\u2019t subject to IR35 rules. It might mean that operating as a sole trader is more tax efficient than contracting through your own limited company if your work falls within IR35.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Find out more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/who-we-help\/contractor-accounting-services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online accounting services for contractors<\/a>, call 020 3355 4047, and <a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">get an instant online quote<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IR35 and off-payroll working rules can be confusing, but it\u2019s important that contractors and their clients understand the processes and rules in&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":54,"featured_media":94438,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[802,565],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Who Is Responsible for my IR35 Status?
