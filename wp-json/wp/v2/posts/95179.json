He explains his role as an accountant here at The Accountancy Partnership.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your job title?<\/h3>\n<p>I am currently an Accounts Senior here at TAP. <\/p>\n<h3>Give an overview of the duties, functions, and responsibilities of your job.<\/h3>\n<p>As a senior accountant, I manage my own portfolio of clients on a daily basis. It\u2019s my job to complete their accounts annually, whether this is for limited companies, partnerships or sole traders. I am here to answer any questions they may have when it comes to all things accounting. <\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 900px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 900\/471;border: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 900px; border-radius: 30px;\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tap-staff-spotlight-quote-1-bill-mcloughlin.png\" alt=\"Bill's quote\" width=\"900\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>What is a typical working day like for you?<\/h3>\n<p>A typical day will start with opening my emails and seeing what needs to be dealt with that day. If I have any consultations in the morning, I will also prep for them. Once I have assessed my emails I get started on a set of accounts, tax return, or VAT return. My day is pretty much structured around emails and queries from clients. <\/p>\n<h3>What particular challenges do you regularly encounter?<\/h3>\n<p>Our processes for completing a set of accounts include time for peer review, where colleagues oversee each other&#8217;s work. It\u2019s an important part of ensuring accuracy and providing a good service, but some clients can leave things quite late and are then under pressure with deadlines. We always try to do what we can, but it can be difficult. <\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges faced by your clients?<\/h3>\n<p>The main challenge that some of my clients&#8217; face is starting their first limited company. Some open a limited company without having any knowledge about how they work or why they can be more tax efficient, and then need to find out more information about it.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your favourite part of the job?<\/h3>\n<p>Independent working. I really like being in control of my own client portfolio and working in the way I find more efficient for me. <\/p>\n<h3>How are you able to use your skills to solve problems for them?<\/h3>\n<p>I have dealt with limited companies for over 15 years, so I know the ins and outs of most situations. From opening the limited company, trading through it, and even closing down.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What do you like most about working for The Accountancy Partnership?<\/h3>\n<p>The team! Everyone here is brilliant. Even under Covid restrictions, the atmosphere in the office is second to none.  Not only does each member of staff support our clients in their specific department, we all support each other. Also, the perks are brilliant, including lunch twice a week and smoothies! <\/p>\n<h3>What skills do you find most useful to do your job?<\/h3>\n<p>I believe I am quite calm under pressure and can deal with most things. We have a high-pressured job which takes a lot to keep on top of. <\/p>\n<h3>Where\u2019s your favourite place to visit during time off?<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t really have one specific place! I enjoy going out on a Saturday as a family to farms, parks and zoos. I also enjoy visiting a pub for a cold pint at the end of the week! <\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your proudest achievement.<\/h3>\n<p>My proudest achievement would be being approved to be a foster carer. Myself and my wife have looked after 4 littles ones since being approved in 2019. We currently have 2 little girls with us at the moment, one of whom we have just been approved to adopt. <\/p>\n<h3>How would your colleagues describe you?<\/h3>\n<p>It depends who you ask! If you ask the people closet to me in the office then I would say random, chatty, brilliant (Mike G\u2019s comment) and a pain in the pod. Those not so close, quiet!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"modal_button\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Online accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>Get a quote and see how much you could be saving!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Get an instant quote<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What are you reading\/binge watching at the moment?<\/h3>\n<p>I am not currently watching anything but I am tempted to rewatch Sons of Anarchy!!!
