To find out what keeps them awake at night, and what external factors might have contributed to these worries \u2013 for example Brexit, the pandemic, the strain of running a business, and sudden remote working.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our research polled 713 SME owners to reveal how these fears have manifested themselves in people\u2019s behaviour, happiness, energy, productivity, and concentration levels, as well as their appetite to continue running a business in the future.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Why was 2020 a record year for new business incorporations?<\/h3>\n<p>2020 saw the inception of a record number of small businesses in the UK. While this is partly a result of the pandemic\u2019s far-reaching effects, such as redundancies and furlough, the influx of start-ups can also be attributed to the fact that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/starting-a-new-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">starting a business is now even easier than ever<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Our previous research into pandemic-born businesses, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-support-for-covid-19\/the-boom-or-bust-report-beginning-a-business-in-a-pandemic-81853.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Boom or Bust Report<\/a>, looked at the new businesses taking the plunge during the pandemic. The report illustrates the complex reasons so many people had for taking their first steps as entrepreneurs in the midst of a global pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>We wanted to understand what inspired owners to become their own bosses, and now we investigate whether the reality of taking their career and earning potential into their own hands matches their expectations.<\/p>\n<h3>Motivations for becoming a business owner \u2013 a better work-life balance?<\/h3>\n<p>In a survey of more than 700 small business owners, almost half (47%) attributed financial reasons as a motivation for starting their business, including the desire to earn more than they did before, or break free from a traditional salary or commission structure.<\/p>\n<p>The need for a better work-life balance was the second most popular reason (43%), with a number of notable studies finding that working from home during the pandemic had led to employees working longer hours. Microsoft\u2019s own <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/07\/microsoft-analyzed-data-on-its-newly-remote-workforce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modern Workplace Transformation<\/a> team worked four hours more each week. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41562-021-01196-4?fbclid=IwAR2LHtfF3u6WqwDIxV35cpBR_cdcaHclqs4v8gWt8I8OCYl4OFB3m_k6yl0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A study published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour<\/a> found that the workweek increased by 10% following the move to remote work.<\/p>\n<p>Our research also revealed two-fifths (40%) of owners started businesses for personal development reasons, while a quarter (25%) did so as they wanted a career change.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A fifth (19%, or 137,940 out of 726,000) of the businesses created last year, were started by people striving to improve their mental health, highlighting entrepreneurs\u2019 desire for control over their own wellbeing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>What are the most common reasons for starting your own business?<\/h4>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\" title=\"Things to consider when setting prices\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-are-the-most-common-reasons-for-starting-your-own-business-info.svg\" alt=\"Things to consider when setting prices\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Financial reasons \u2013 47%<\/li>\n<li>Better work-life balance \u2013 43%<\/li>\n<li>Personal development \u2013 40%<\/li>\n<li>Career change \u2013 25%<\/li>\n<li>Mental health reasons \u2013 19%<\/li>\n<li>To spend more time with family \u2013 19%<\/li>\n<li>Redundancy \u2013 12%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This trend towards mental health and wellbeing was further highlighted when the panel of SME owners were asked to identify what they found most challenging about working for someone else, before starting their own business and becoming self-employed.<\/p>\n<p>41% of SME owners reported feeling underappreciated in their previous employment, something <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/news\/press\/releases\/2012\/03\/well-being\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an American Psychological Association study<\/a> found was linked to wellbeing and performance. Those that feel valued are more likely to report better physical and mental health, as well as higher levels of satisfaction and motivation, versus those who do not feel valued by their employers.<\/p>\n<p>Not having enough scope for development (37%), difficult relationships with bosses (20%), and a lack of control over workload (28%) were also common contributors to employees making the move to becoming their own boss.<\/p>\n<p>Again, financial motivation, in the form of not being able to earn the desired salary, motivated almost one-in-three (30%) to begin their own enterprise. A quarter (26%) also found long working hours challenging when working for someone else.<\/p>\n<h4>What did you find most challenging about being employed?<\/h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Not feeling appreciated \u2013 41%<\/li>\n<li>Not enough scope for development \u2013 37%<\/li>\n<li>Poorly managed organisation \u2013 36%<\/li>\n<li>Can\u2019t earn desired salary \u2013 30%<\/li>\n<li>Lack of control over workload 28%<\/li>\n<li>Lack of creativity \u2013 27%<\/li>\n<li>Long hours \u2013 26%<\/li>\n<li>Difficult relationship with boss \u2013 20%<\/li>\n<li>Lack of support from manager \u2013 19%<\/li>\n<li>Pressure to perform \u2013 15%<\/li>\n<li>Fear of being laid off \u2013 10%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What are the positive impacts of starting a business?<\/h3>\n<p>Beginning a business is often filled with the promise of brighter days and the ability to have complete freedom. Our panel were asked if this was actually the case.<\/p>\n<p>When asked what they were hoping for when starting their business, three quarters (75%) of SME owners said they anticipated more flexibility, six out of every ten (60%) envisioned a better work-life balance, and around the same saw increased earning potential (59%).<\/p>\n<p>More than half (52%) of new businesses owners started with the ambition of more autonomy, and a similar number (48%) did so to increase their opportunities for personal development. Interestingly, 40% started a new business to provide a creative outlet.<\/p>\n<p>More than a third (36%) aspired to improve their mental health, and 31% started their own enterprise to reduce the amount of daily stress. High levels of daily stress can lead to burnout and other serious mental health issues if left unaddressed in the long term. These mental health motivations for starting a new business were held by more than a quarter of a million (261,360) new business owners last year alone.<\/p>\n<h4>What positive impacts did you hope starting a new business would have on your life?<\/h4>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\" title=\"Things to consider when setting prices\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-positive-impacts-did-you-hope-starting-a-new-business-would-have-on-your-life-info.svg\" alt=\"Things to consider when setting prices\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>More flexibility \u2013 75%<\/li>\n<li>Better work-life balance \u2013 60%<\/li>\n<li>Increased earning potential \u2013 59%<\/li>\n<li>More autonomy \u2013 52%<\/li>\n<li>Increase personal development \u2013 48%<\/li>\n<li>Provide a creative outlet \u2013 40%<\/li>\n<li>Improve mental health \u2013 36%<\/li>\n<li>More variety day-to-day \u2013 35%<\/li>\n<li>Less daily stress \u2013 31%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Does owning a business improve mental wellbeing?<\/h3>\n<p>On the whole, entrepreneurs have seen vast improvements in their happiness since starting their own businesses. More than half (54%) said they feel much happier, 28% are better-off although it has been harder than they expected, and one in 10 (10%) are happier but not as happy as they thought they\u2019d be. Therefore, the majority of those making the move to self-employment and beginning a business found it bettered their mental wellbeing.<\/p>\n<p>Positively, just 1% of entrepreneurs polled said they were less happy since starting their business, and there are a variety of reasons for a less significant than expected change since becoming an SME owner, including financial support and a lack of mentoring.<\/p>\n<h4>Has starting a business had the positive impact you hoped?<\/h4>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"infographic1 lazyload\" style=\"max-width: 760px;\" title=\"Things to consider when setting prices\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Has-starting-a-business-had-the-positive-impact-you-hoped-info.svg\" alt=\"Things to consider when setting prices\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/div>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Yes, I feel much happier since starting my own business \u2013 54%<\/li>\n<li>Yes, but it has been harder than expected \u2013 28%<\/li>\n<li>Yes, but not to the extent that I imagined \u2013 10%<\/li>\n<li>No, my life hasn\u2019t changed much \u2013 5%<\/li>\n<li>No, I am less happy than before \u2013 1%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What are the biggest issues when starting a business?<\/h3>\n<p>Despite a significant proportion setting out with dreams of more money and a better work-life balance, a quarter (25%) of those SME owners who are less happy than anticipated are struggling to support themselves financially, and one fifth (22%) find switching off difficult, resulting in a poor work-life balance.<\/p>\n<p>Government support and grants have been a big topic of discussion with some business owners finding themselves excluded from support. However, the Government has also provided <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/business-support-for-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a series of lifelines to businesses<\/a> to ensure their continuity during difficult and unpredictable times.<\/p>\n<p>Almost a quarter (22%) of entrepreneurs felt that administrative duties, such as filing paperwork or accounting, had led to feelings of unhappiness, as owners have a series of deadlines which they must adhere to. An additional 7% struggled with the broader type of work involved in being an owner versus an employee.<\/p>\n<p>Some entrepreneurs (12%) are working longer hours than they were when they were employed. Encouragingly, only 2% found that having responsibility for employees increased their stress levels.<\/p>\n<h4>What has been the biggest cause of your unhappiness as a business owner?<\/h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Difficulties supporting myself financially \u2013 25%<\/li>\n<li>Administrative duties of filing paperwork \u2013 22%<\/li>\n<li>More difficult to switch off than before, resulting in poor work-life balance \u2013 21%<\/li>\n<li>Having to work longer hours than before \u2013 12%<\/li>\n<li>Broader types of work involved than being employed \u2013 7%<\/li>\n<li>Increased stress due to responsibility for employees \u2013 2%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>The pandemic\u2019s impact on SME owners\u2019 mental health<\/h3>\n<p>When discussing mental health and entrepreneurialism, it is impossible not to consider the pandemic&#8217;s impact on SME owners\u2019 mental health, with more than half (55%) citing it as having the most detrimental impact. This is more than twice as many as the next reason, with a quarter (25%) saying the general strain of running a business was most damaging.<\/p>\n<p>A fifth (19%) of business owners said that Brexit had the greatest impact on their mental health, with huge disruption to the supply chain and the international workforce.<\/p>\n<p>6% of SME owners said the sudden move to remote working for all non-essential businesses was most damaging, while the forced business closure for many public facing businesses played on the mind of 8% of SME owners, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors.<\/p>\n<p>In the next chapter of the SME Owner Mental Health report, we will examine how the pandemic affected entrepreneurs in greater detail, and look at the concerns that have kept them up over the past year.<\/p>\n<h4>What has the most detrimental impact on SME owners&#8217; mental health?<\/h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Coronavirus pandemic &#8211; 55%<\/li>\n<li>General strains of running a business &#8211; 25%<\/li>\n<li>Brexit &#8211; 19%<\/li>\n<li>Forced business closure &#8211; 8%<\/li>\n<li>Sudden remote working &#8211; 6%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Learn more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/who-we-help\/startup-business-accountants\">online accounting services for small businesses and startups<\/a>.
