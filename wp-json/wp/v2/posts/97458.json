Your asset should also grow in value, offering a handy nest egg when retirement rolls around.<\/p>\n<p>But whether you\u2019re a long-established landlord with a substantial portfolio or you\u2019re new to the landlord game with a single buy-to-let property, there\u2019s a lot to think about. The biggest considerations are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/do-landlords-pay-tax-60715.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paying tax as a landlord<\/a>, and the legal structure you\u2019ll use to rent out your property (or properties).<\/p>\n<p>One question we get asked a lot is whether it\u2019s better to own a buy-to-let or other property as a sole trader or to set up a company which owns it (sometimes known as a Special-Purpose Vehicle company, or SPV).<\/p>\n<p>We look a little deeper into the options available for sole traders and limited companies to help you figure out the best way forward. It\u2019s not a case of one size fits all!<\/p>\n<h3>What is a Special-Purpose Vehicle Company?<\/h3>\n<p>As far as HMRC and Companies House are concerned, a Special-Purpose Vehicle (SPV) company is the same as any other limited company that you set up (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/incorporation\/how-to-register-as-a-limited-company-in-the-uk-60721.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a process known as incorporation<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">The term SPV is more typically used in the mortgage industry, and refers to a limited company which is only used to buy and own properties.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nThis is because lenders want to reassure themselves as much as possible that the company is financially \u2018safe\u2019, and focuses on property (the bit that your mortgage lender is interested in), rather than any other business activities on top of that. Adding other activities in to the mix might make your company seem like more of a financial risk.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the difference between owning property as a limited company and being a sole trader?<\/h3>\n<p>Renting out a house, flat, or other property through a company means it\u2019s the limited company which receives the rental income, and therefore the company which pays tax on that income \u2013 in the form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/corporation-tax-for-limited-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Corporation Tax<\/a>. To take any of that income out of the business for yourself then you\u2019ll normally either pay yourself a salary as an employee of the company, pay yourself dividends, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/whats-the-most-tax-efficient-directors-salary-in-2022_23-51622.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a tax efficient combination of the two<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you own the property personally as a sole trader, then there\u2019s no distinction between you and the business. This means you\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/self-assessment-tax-returns-for-landlords-245905.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">submit Self Assessment tax returns<\/a> and pay income tax on all of the income that the business receives from renting out the property, regardless of whether or not you take any of it for yourself.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/property-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Property accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Accounting for landlords and investors from \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of creating a limited company for my property?<\/h3>\n<p>Like most business decisions, deciding to own and rent out property through a limited company boils down to tax efficiency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-operating-as-a-limited-company-14752.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">although there are other pros and cons too<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Offsetting mortgage interest against income<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/expenses\/limited-company-expenses-guide-can-claim-6140.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Limited companies are allowed to claim tax relief on mortgage interest<\/a>, and offset it against any profit they make from rental income. This reduces the amount of profit, and therefore lowers their tax bill, because businesses pay Corporation Tax on their <em>profits<\/em>, not on income.<\/p>\n<div class=\"actionbox\">Sole traders are no longer automatically allowed to deduct some costs from their rental income (like mortgage interest).<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nSo, owning the property through a limited company means you may be able to make a saving against the typical income tax rates paid by sole traders or partnerships.<\/p>\n<h4>Paying yourself from your property portfolio<\/h4>\n<p>By setting up as a limited company, you\u2019re also giving yourself a much more flexible range of options when it comes to taking money from your property business.<\/p>\n<p>These days,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/guides-videos\/dividends-and-taking-a-salary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> most company owners pay themselves using a mixture of salary and dividends<\/a> which we mentioned earlier. Doing it this way means you\u2019re still \u2018paying into the system\u2019 and therefore protecting your state pension and access to other benefits, whilst minimising your tax burden.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a sole trader, you\u2019ll personally pay income tax on all the profits that the business makes, unlike a company owner who only pays tax on the money they take out of the business.<\/p>\n<h4>Personal liability<\/h4>\n<p>Renting out your property as a company brings all the usual advantages of limited liability. So, if you were to hit financial trouble, as a company director you wouldn\u2019t need to worry about selling your own house, car, or other personal assets. These would still be at risk if you were a sole trader.<\/p>\n<h4>BTL properties and capital gains tax<\/h4>\n<p>If an individual disposes of an asset, they\u2019ll pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/the-basics-of-capital-gains-tax-45500.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Capital Gains Tax (CGT)<\/a> on the profit, or \u2018gain\u2019, that they make from doing so, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/a-guide-to-capital-gains-tax-on-property-134835.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">special Capital Gains rules in place for properties<\/a>. Companies don\u2019t pay CGT, because they pay Corporation Tax on any profits that they make instead.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to grow your property portfolio, such as acquiring more buy-to-lets, then owning them through a limited company could help you do so more quickly. This is because not paying CGT puts more of the earnings back into the business, giving you a handy leg up in expanding your property portfolio faster.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit of a minefield which is why we always recommend talking to our team about the tax benefits of operating as a sole trader versus a limited company. We\u2019ll look at your individual circumstances to offer tailored advice.<\/p>\n<h3>Why should I be cautious about renting out property through a limited company?<\/h3>\n<p>Taking the \u201ccompany route\u201d sounds like a no-brainer, and for many it is. But there are still some very valid reasons as to why you might choose not to incorporate your business. Whilst incorporation will reduce your personal liability, it will also bring with it a whole host of new responsibilities and statutory requirements.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/k0Ui47Pfrwg?si=CJL9E30U9FcByurD\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The responsibilities that come with owning a limited company include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Registering with Companies House<\/li>\n<li>Keeping accurate, up-to-date company records<\/li>\n<li>Preparing and filing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-model-articles-of-association-in-a-limited-company-196848.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">articles of association<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Filing compliant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/what-are-annual-accounts-13527.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">annual accounts<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting a Company Tax Return to pay Corporation Tax<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Reporting any changes, for example if your name or address changes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It involves a fair amount of bureaucracy and paperwork, which takes time and effort. It\u2019s all pretty routine and shouldn\u2019t put you off, but it can be daunting, so it\u2019s a good idea that you take professional advice along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Note too that limited company directors are legally required to publish their name and address which some landlords find off-putting &#8211; particularly if they\u2019re renting out properties as a side-line to a separate career, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/do-accidental-landlords-need-to-pay-tax-224714.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which is often the case if you&#8217;re an &#8216;accidental&#8217; landlord<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to buy a property in order to rent it out and need to get a mortgage, then you\u2019ll need to tackle the issue of actually getting a buy-to-let mortgage for a limited company too. Although such products exist, they are often known for having less favourable terms than those for people who are operating as a sole trader, or who can show that they\u2019re an SPV, like we discussed earlier.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, the savings you make on tax will adequately cover any extra mortgage costs, so it\u2019s still worth doing &#8211; but think about it carefully and let us run some numbers for you first.<\/p>\n<h3>So, what are the advantages of renting out a property as a sole trader?<\/h3>\n<p>While there are benefits to renting out a property as a company, there are some downsides. Depending on how you feel about these downsides may mean you decide to operate as a sole trader. For example:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Obtaining a buy-to-let mortgage as a sole trader can be much easier, although there\u2019s still the usual hoops to jump through including fees and affordability<\/li>\n<li>Switching to a limited company incurs its own costs, and you\u2019ll need to pay tax on any money you pay yourself out of the company<\/li>\n<li>Operating as a sole trader means you simply keep the profits that you make, so you can access your funds more quickly and easily<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/who-we-help\/limited-company-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Limited company accountancy services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a354.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Can I transfer property ownership in and out of the company?<\/h3>\n<p>If you already have a portfolio of several properties and you\u2019re looking at transferring them to your new limited company, you could get stung by property tax (which varies depending on where your property is), as well as Capital Gains Tax.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>England and Northern Ireland &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/landlords\/do-i-need-to-pay-stamp-duty-4489.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Scotland &#8211; Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT)<\/li>\n<li>Wales &#8211; Land Transaction Tax (LTT)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The two different types of tax kick in because you\u2019re expected to \u201csell\u201d your properties to your company at a reasonable (market) price. So, you, as an individual, could well be burdened with CGT while the company must pay the property tax (such as stamp duty, or land transaction tax).<\/p>\n<p>Again, the long-term tax savings may well make this a good option &#8211; but it\u2019s essential you do your homework.<\/p>\n<h3>I\u2019m based abroad. What does this mean for setting up a UK limited buy-to-let company?<\/h3>\n<p>If your main residence is overseas and you want to invest in UK property, you\u2019ll need to look even more closely at the challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a limited company won\u2019t mitigate the property tax surcharge if you\u2019re a non-UK resident. It\u2019s a rule that only came into effect recently, increasing the tax which foreign property owners must pay. Many investors from overseas also often report difficulties with getting decent mortgage rates from UK lenders.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Call 020 3355 4047 to speak to one of our team about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/property-accountants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online accounting services for landlords<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/callback-request\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ask us to call you back<\/a>.
