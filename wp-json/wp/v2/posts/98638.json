It\u2019s not an easy subject to think about, but a person&#8217;s tax affairs will need dealing with even after they\u2019ve passed away. If this is your first encounter with a Self Assessment tax return, we\u2019ll take a step back for a second.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a Self Assessment tax return?<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/submitting-self-assessment-tax-returns-3718.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Self Assessment tax return<\/a> is essentially a declaration which shows a person\u2019s untaxed income, expenses, and other costs. HMRC use the figures reported to calculate how much tax that person still owes.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nGenerally only those who are self-employed or who have extra untaxed income need to complete one. For instance, the director of a limited company needs to complete a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/company-tax-return\/company-tax-returns-and-corporation-tax-3746.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Company Tax Return<\/a> for the company, but might also need to submit a Self Assessment return to declare any personal income that they take from the business which hasn\u2019t already been taxed (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/limited-company\/dividends\/what-are-dividends-1696.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">normally in the form of dividends<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Some income doesn\u2019t need to be included in a Self Assessment tax return, such as any interest earned from an ISA. This is because it\u2019s tax-free.<\/p>\n<p>If the person who died was submitting a Self Assessment tax return each year, or was about to start doing so, then one final return following their death will need submitting too.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I need to report the death to HMRC?<\/h3>\n<p>When a person passes away, you\u2019ll need to let the government know as soon as possible. You can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/after-a-death\/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tell Us Once service<\/a> to do this and like the name suggests, you tell them once and the service will pass this information on to all of the relevant government agencies. If you use this service, you don\u2019t need to contact HMRC separately.<\/p>\n<p>You can still contact HMRC if you want to though, and might find it useful to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/organisations\/hm-revenue-customs\/contact\/bereavement-and-deceased-estate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ask for tax help using their bereavement and deceased helpline<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be asked to provide the name and address of someone they can contact regarding the deceased person\u2019s tax affairs, as well as to confirm the exact date of death. HMRC will also ask for some details about the person who died, including:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>Their National Insurance (NI) number<\/li>\n<li>Their full address<\/li>\n<li>Information about their last employer, such as the company name and address<\/li>\n<li>Their pension provider (if they have one)<\/li>\n<li>Their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/where-can-i-find-my-unique-taxpayer-reference-utr-number-1403.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) number<\/a>, which you can find on any letters sent to them by HMRC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>HMRC will confirm whether or not a Self Assessment tax return is necessary, and send out a paper tax return form with instructions on how to fill it out.<\/p>\n<h3>What will I need to fill out the tax return itself?<\/h3>\n<p>Completing and submitting a tax return on behalf of someone who has died means you\u2019ll need access to that person\u2019s private records. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/checklist-for-completion-of-self-assessment-tax-return-2831.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exact records you need depends on their circumstances<\/a>, but will usually include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/bookkeeping\/what-is-bookkeeping-the-complete-guide-to-keeping-financial-records-for-your-business-90882.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bookkeeping records or accounts<\/a> which relate to their business or any income earned from renting out property<\/li>\n<li>Bank statements or building society pass books<\/li>\n<li>Documents which relate to any savings schemes, such as National Savings bonds or certificates<\/li>\n<li>Dividend vouchers, if they were a company director<\/li>\n<li>Payslips or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/payroll\/what-is-a-p60-for-3738.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">P60 <\/a>if they also worked for an employer<\/li>\n<li>The details of any pensions. This might include payments they were receiving from a State or personal pension, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/pensions\/do-i-need-to-declare-payments-into-a-private-pension-on-my-tax-return-180750.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payments they made into a private pension fund<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Information about any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-are-they-221721.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">benefits in kind<\/a> they received, such as a company car. This information will be available on their copy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/benefits-in-kind-biks\/what-is-a-p11d-form-31299.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the P11D form used to report the benefits<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, you can contact the HMRC bereavement and deceased service if you have any questions or are struggling to find the records required. You might also need to include information which relates to the administration period.<\/p>\n<h4>What\u2019s an administration period for someone\u2019s estate?<\/h4>\n<p>The gap in time between the day after the person\u2019s death and the date when their estate is settled is called the &#8216;administration period&#8217;. If you are the executor or administrator of their estate, then you might need to give HMRC certain information about the administration period.<\/p>\n<p>The size of their estate will determine what information you must provide. You might need to include money which arrives in to their estate during the administration period on their Self Assessment tax return. This would include things like any rent payments received from tenants, or income from dividends received after death.<\/p>\n<h4>How does this work?<\/h4>\n<p>If you need to send a Self Assessment tax return to cover the administration period, and any of the following apply, then you should also complete the trust and estate section:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: url('\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/check-mark.svg');\">\n<li>The total amount of tax due for the administration period exceeds \u00a310,000 (this would be Income Tax and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/capital-gains-tax\/the-basics-of-capital-gains-tax-45500.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Capital Gains Tax<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Money resulting from the sale of estate assets by administrators or executors in any tax year that ended before 6th April 2016, which totalled more than \u00a3250,000<\/li>\n<li>More than \u00a3500,000 resulted from the sale of estate assets by administrators or executors in the current tax year. A tax year starts 6th April and ends 5th April.<\/li>\n<li>The estate\u2019s value at the time of death was more than \u00a32.5 million<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Will I need to register for Self Assessment to submit a tax return for someone who has died?<\/h3>\n<p>You won\u2019t need to register yourself personally, but you will need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/registering\/do-i-need-to-register-for-self-assessment-if-im-not-self-employed-3839.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register the estate for Self Assessment<\/a>, even if the person who died was already registered.<\/p>\n<p>Once you register the estate, HMRC will send a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/where-can-i-find-my-unique-taxpayer-reference-utr-number-1403.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) number<\/a>. This will be different to the UTR number that was issued to the person who has passed away, so mark them clearly to avoid getting confused.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/services\/tax-return-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"bannerbox\">\n<div  class=\"bannerwrap\">\n<div class=\"bannerleft\">\n<h3>Comprehensive tax return services<\/h3>\n<p>From only \u00a324.50 per month<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bannerright\">\n<div class=\"bannercta\">Learn more<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>When do I need to submit the tax return for someone who died?<\/h3>\n<p>HMRC will confirm the tax return deadline in the letter which comes with the form.

In other words, their estate pays their tax bill.<\/p>\n<p>Many banks will make a payment directly to HMRC. However, if no funds are available (perhaps because probate has not been granted) a loan or other financing may need to be arranged to pay the tax due. Any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/tax\/what-happens-if-i-pay-too-much-tax-3729.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax rebates that are owed<\/a> will form part of the deceased\u2019s estate.<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t forget, your own tax position may also now change<\/h3>\n<p>When a spouse, civil partner or partner passes away, it can affect your own tax position too. A common example would be where the surviving partner starts receiving income from rental properties or investments that used to be paid to the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not uncommon for non-taxpayers to suddenly need to start paying tax because they\u2019ve inherited an income stream from someone who has died.<\/p>\n<p>When you contact HMRC, they will review your new tax position and also confirm if you must start submitting Self Assessment tax returns for yourself. If you do, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/self-assessment\/how-does-a-sole-trader-register-for-self-assessment-14776.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register in your own right before the registration deadline<\/a>. You\u2019ll receive your own unique UTR number, which will be different to the one you received to submit a return for the estate.<\/p>\n<p><em>Dealing with someone\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccountancy.co.uk\/understanding-accountancy-terms-faqs\/what-happens-when-a-business-owner-dies-unexpectedly-30840.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">business tax affairs after they\u2019ve passed away<\/a> can be confusing and emotional.
